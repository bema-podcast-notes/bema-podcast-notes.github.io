### BEMA Episode 161 Study Notes: 1 Thessalonians — Parousia

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 161: 1 Thessalonians — Parousia  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Topic:** This episode explores the Greek concept of *parousia* (the "second coming") through its original Roman imperial context, revealing how Paul's teaching about Christ's return was actually a call to active engagement rather than passive waiting. The discussion centers on 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 and challenges common "rapture theology" by demonstrating how Paul used familiar Roman imperial imagery to teach about Christian responsibility and kingdom work.

#### Key Takeaways

- *Parousia* was a well-known Roman imperial term referring to an emperor's "second coming" to survey earthquake reconstruction work
- Thessalonica experienced at least two imperial *parousias* in the first century, making Paul's metaphor especially vivid for this audience
- Paul's description of Christ's return follows the exact pattern of a Roman *parousia*: trumpet sound, honoring the dead, and *eis apantesien* (going out to meet)
- The theology that uses this passage to support "rapture" theology commits the same error as the Thessalonians: disengagement from worldly work
- Christ's return is described as coming "down" while believers go "up" to meet Him - then return together to earth
- The passage teaches urgent physical engagement with kingdom work, not escapist disengagement
- Christians are given a "deposit" (the Holy Spirit) and will need to show Jesus what they accomplished with it
- The goal is active participation in *tikkun olam* (repairing the world) rather than waiting for evacuation

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Roman Imperial *Parousia*

In the earthquake-prone Roman Empire, the *parousia* was a well-established imperial practice with predictable elements:

**The Emperor's First Coming:** After a major earthquake, the emperor would visit the devastated city to survey damage and assess needs. This was purely investigative.

**The Imperial Deposit:** Following his assessment, the emperor would leave behind a substantial sum of money (often millions of sesterces) for reconstruction efforts. This was understood as a loan/investment requiring accountability.

**The Promise of Return:** Everyone understood that the emperor would return for a "second coming" (*parousia*) to inspect what had been accomplished with his deposit.

##### The Pattern of *Parousia*

Roman *parousias* followed a consistent structure that Paul deliberately echoes:

**Trumpet Announcement:** City lookouts would sound trumpets when the imperial entourage was spotted approaching, giving the city time to prepare for the emperor's arrival.

**Honoring the Dead:** Upon entering the city, the emperor would first pay respects at the necropolis (cemetery) located just inside the city gates, honoring those who built what came before.

**The *Eis Apantesien*:** This Greek phrase describes the specific practice of citizens going out from the city to meet the approaching emperor with joy, then escorting him back into the city to show him their accomplishments.

**The Inspection:** The emperor would be led around the city to see how his deposit had been used - ideally resulting in improvements beyond what existed before the disaster.

##### Paul's Application to Christ's Return

Paul deliberately structures his description of Christ's return (1 Thessalonians 4:16-18) to mirror the Roman *parousia*:

- **Trumpet call** announcing Christ's approach
- **Dead in Christ rise first** (honoring those who came before)
- **Living believers caught up to *eis apantesien*** (going out to meet Him)
- **Direction of movement:** Christ coming down, believers going up to meet Him, then returning together

##### The Thessalonian Problem

The church in Thessalonica had developed a theological problem: believing Christ's return was so imminent that physical work became pointless. Some members were:

- Quitting their jobs and vocations
- Disengaging from daily responsibilities  
- Expecting immediate evacuation from earthly concerns

This mirrors modern "rapture theology" that emphasizes escape from the world rather than transformation of it.

##### Paul's Counter-Theology

Rather than supporting escapist thinking, Paul's *parousia* metaphor teaches:

**Active Engagement:** Just as cities had to actively rebuild with the emperor's deposit, Christians must actively work with the Holy Spirit's empowerment.

**Accountability:** The emperor expected to see improvements when he returned; Christ expects to see kingdom work accomplished.

**Physical Participation:** The *parousia* was about improving the physical world, not abandoning it. Paul teaches "physical participation" rather than "disembodied evacuation."

**Present Responsibility:** The focus should be on current work that will have something to show when Christ returns.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Context Examples

**Thessalonica's Experience:** Having experienced at least two imperial *parousias* in the first century, Thessalonian Christians would immediately understand Paul's metaphor and its implications for active engagement.

**Earthquake Reconstruction:** Roman cities like those in modern-day Turkey show evidence of reconstruction efforts funded by imperial deposits, with visible improvements and dedications to the emperors who provided resources.

**Ray Vander Laan's Turkish Village Story:** The episode shares a powerful modern parallel where American visitors left a monetary "deposit" with a Turkish village mayor. Years later, they returned to find the village had become the #1 ranked school district in Turkey, with the mayor eagerly showing them the accomplishments - a perfect picture of joyful accountability at the *parousia*.

##### Contemporary Applications

**Christian Vocation:** Rather than viewing secular work as meaningless in light of Christ's return, believers should see their vocations as part of kingdom work requiring excellence and accountability.

**Social Justice:** The *parousia* theology supports active engagement in addressing systemic problems rather than waiting for divine intervention to fix them.

**Environmental Stewardship:** Christians are called to improve the physical world as stewards of God's "deposit," not to abandon it as temporary.

**Community Development:** Like the Turkish village, Christian communities should be actively working to make their contexts better, more just, and more flourishing.

##### Theological Implications

**Prayer Application:** Jesus taught us to pray "Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven" - an active request for present transformation, not future escape.

***Tikkun Olam*:** The Jewish concept of "repairing the world" aligns with Paul's *parousia* theology, emphasizing human partnership in restoration work.

**Kingdom Theology:** God's kingdom comes through human participation in divine work, not through human evacuation from earthly responsibility.

#### Brief Personalized Summary

BEMA Episode 161 provides a revolutionary reframing of one of the most misunderstood passages in Christian theology. By revealing the Roman imperial context of *parousia*, Marty transforms 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 from a proof-text for escapist "rapture theology" into a powerful call for engaged kingdom work.

The episode's central insight - that Paul deliberately used familiar imperial imagery to teach about Christian responsibility - brilliantly exposes how modern evangelicalism has often inverted the apostle's intended message. Rather than supporting disengagement from worldly concerns, Paul's *parousia* metaphor argues for urgent, accountable participation in God's restoration work.

The Turkish village story serves as a perfect modern illustration, showing the joy and pride that comes from faithful stewardship of entrusted resources. This image of running across a field in excitement to show Jesus what we've accomplished with His "deposit" is both inspiring and convicting.

Perhaps most challenging is the recognition that much Christian theology has inadvertently promoted the same error Paul was correcting in Thessalonica. The call to active engagement - working for justice, restoration, and flourishing in our physical world - stands as a necessary corrective to any theology that treats earth as something to escape rather than something to heal and restore.

The episode concludes with a powerful vision: Christians as partners with God in *tikkun olam* (repairing the world), actively participating in making creation "more ordered, more shalom-filled, more holy" while we await Christ's return. This is theology that inspires both present engagement and future hope.

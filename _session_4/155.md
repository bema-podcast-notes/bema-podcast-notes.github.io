### BEMA Episode 155: Romans — God's Mission, Paul's Mission

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 155: Romans — God's Mission, Paul's Mission  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Topic:** Paul's concluding arguments in Romans 14-16, examining disputable matters, unity across differences, Paul's missionary calling, and the beautiful chiastic structure that reveals the "obedience of faith."

This final episode in the Romans series explores Paul's practical wisdom for navigating gray areas in faith, his vision for Jewish-Gentile unity, his personal mission to the Gentiles, and the literary masterpiece that ties the entire letter together through the concept of "obedience of faith."

#### Key Takeaways

- Faith communities contain both "weak" and "strong" believers - terms describing scope of conviction, not spiritual maturity
- Disputable matters exist in faith - not everything is black and white, and Christians must learn to navigate gray areas with love
- Both abstaining and engaging camps must avoid judging each other and focus on building up rather than condemning
- Paul's life mission was to demonstrate that Gentiles could worship the God of Israel alongside Jewish believers
- Romans follows a beautiful chiastic structure centered on "no condemnation" (Romans 8:1)
- The "obedience of faith" involves unity between different groups, not earning salvation through works
- Women played crucial leadership roles in Paul's ministry, challenging some traditional interpretations

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Weak vs. Strong Faith

Paul uses these terms not to indicate spiritual maturity but to describe the scope of someone's faith convictions:

- **"Weak" faith:** Narrower, more restrictive convictions (abstaining from certain foods, observing special days)
- **"Strong" faith:** Broader freedom in Christ (eating all foods, treating all days alike)

Neither position indicates greater or lesser spiritual maturity - they represent different approaches to living out faith.

##### Disputable Matters

Paul acknowledges that gray areas exist in Christian living:

- Not everything fits into neat black-and-white moral categories
- Examples include food restrictions, observing special days, entertainment choices
- These matters require personal conviction guided by conscience and Scripture
- The key is not the specific decision but how we treat others who decide differently

##### The Stumbling Block Principle

Properly understood, stumbling blocks are not about the disputable matter itself but about our treatment of each other:

- **Misapplication:** Using "stumbling block" to enforce personal convictions on others
- **Paul's meaning:** Ensuring our lifestyle choices don't hinder others' pursuit of God
- The principle applies both ways - neither camp should create obstacles for the other
- Focus should be on peace, mutual edification, and building up the community

##### God's Mission Through Paul

Paul's calling centered on demonstrating God's inclusive plan:

- **Historical context:** Gentiles coming to worship the God of Israel was unprecedented
- **Paul's role:** Pioneer missionary to unreached Gentile territories
- **Biblical foundation:** Paul quotes from all sections of the Hebrew Bible (Law, Prophets, Writings) to show God's plan was always inclusive
- **Collection project:** Gentile churches supporting Jewish believers in Jerusalem as practical demonstration of unity

##### The Chiastic Structure of Romans

The entire letter forms an *inclusio* (literary bracket) around the phrase "obedience of faith":

**Front Half (Chapters 1-7): What Obedience Is NOT:**

- All fall short (1-3)
- All you do is trust (4-5)  
- Struggle of flesh (6-7)

**Center (Chapter 8:1): "No Condemnation"**
The theological heart - no condemnation for anyone in Christ Jesus

**Back Half (Chapters 9-16): What Obedience IS:**

- All can instruct (15-16)
- All you do is love (12-14)
- Struggle of clay (9-11)

##### Women in Paul's Ministry

The closing greetings reveal Paul's extensive collaboration with women:

- **Phoebe:** Deacon and benefactor who likely carried the letter to Rome
- **Priscilla:** Co-worker who risked her life for Paul
- **Junia:** "Outstanding among the apostles" (church history attempted to masculinize this name)
- **Multiple women:** Described as working "very hard" in ministry

This evidence challenges interpretations that paint Paul as anti-women, suggesting his restrictive passages must be understood in specific local contexts.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Navigating Disputable Matters

**Personal Conviction Applications:**

- Following your conscience even when others have freedom you don't feel
- Not imposing your standards on others who have different convictions
- Seeking to understand rather than judge those who make different choices
- Keeping personal convictions "between yourself and God"

**Community Applications:**

- Church decisions about alcohol, entertainment, dietary choices, holiday observances
- Parenting decisions about media consumption, educational choices, social activities
- Workplace ethics in gray areas where Scripture doesn't give explicit guidance
- Political participation and civic engagement approaches

##### Building Unity Across Differences

**Practical Steps:**

- Accepting others as Christ has accepted you
- Seeking to please your neighbor for their good rather than yourself
- Making every effort toward peace and mutual edification
- Avoiding speech or actions that could become stumbling blocks
- Celebrating diversity within unity rather than demanding uniformity

##### Mission and Ministry Applications

**Personal Mission:**

- Finding your unique calling within God's broader mission
- Supporting others' ministries even when they serve different populations
- Understanding your role in the larger story of God's inclusive love
- Being willing to go where Christ has not yet been proclaimed

**Church Mission:**

- Embracing the "blended family" vision of Jewish and Gentile believers
- Recognizing that all believers are competent to instruct one another
- Supporting cross-cultural ministry and missions
- Demonstrating practical unity through shared resources and mutual care

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Historical Jewish-Gentile Relations:** Studying the specific cultural and religious tensions between Jews and Gentiles in first-century Rome and how Paul's solutions applied

2. **Comparative Analysis of Disputable Matters:** Examining how different Christian traditions have categorized various practices and the principles used for discernment

3. **Women's Leadership in Early Christianity:** Investigating the roles of women mentioned in Romans 16 and reconciling this with Paul's restrictive passages in other letters

4. **Pauline Mission Strategy:** Analyzing Paul's church planting methodology and his focus on unreached territories as a model for modern missions

5. **Literary Structure in Scripture:** Exploring other biblical examples of chiasms and *inclusios* and their theological significance

6. **The Collection Project:** Studying Paul's efforts to have Gentile churches support Jewish believers and its significance for church unity today

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does Paul's distinction between "weak" and "strong" faith differ from our modern understanding of spiritual maturity, and what implications does this have for how we view other believers?

2. What does Paul mean by "disputable matters," and how should Christians navigate these gray areas while maintaining both personal integrity and community unity?

3. How does the principle of "stumbling blocks" apply to both abstaining and engaging believers, and why has this teaching often been misapplied in church contexts?

4. What evidence does Paul provide that God's inclusion of the Gentiles was always part of His plan, and how does this support his mission to unreached peoples?

5. How does the chiastic structure of Romans, centered on "no condemnation," illuminate Paul's concept of "obedience of faith" as unity rather than works-righteousness?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

BEMA Episode 155 brings Paul's magnificent letter full circle, revealing both practical wisdom for church life and theological brilliance in literary structure. Paul's handling of disputable matters offers a masterclass in Christian maturity - holding firm convictions while extending grace to those who differ. His vision extends beyond individual piety to community transformation: Jews and Gentiles, men and women, all working together as competent partners in God's mission. The revelation of Romans' chiastic structure is breathtaking - the entire argument hinges on "no condemnation," making unity possible across all human divisions. Paul's extensive collaboration with women challenges narrow interpretations while his missionary passion demonstrates what "obedience of faith" actually looks like: not earning God's favor but living out His inclusive love. The episode leaves us with both practical tools for navigating differences and a grand vision of God's mission to create one family from all peoples. This conclusion to Romans doesn't just end a letter study - it provides a blueprint for the kind of community that reveals God's character to the world.

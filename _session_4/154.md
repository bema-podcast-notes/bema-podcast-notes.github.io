### BEMA Episode 154: Romans — Therefore

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 154: Romans — Therefore  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Topic:** Paul's transition from theological argument to practical application in Romans 12-16, focusing on the "therefore" that connects God's mercy to our response of love and sacrificial living.

This episode examines how Paul moves from 11 chapters of theological foundation about unity between Jews and Gentiles to the practical implications of living as one body in Christ, emphasizing love as the only logical response to God's mercy.

#### Key Takeaways

- Paul's "therefore" in Romans 12:1 connects God's mercy (chapters 1-11) to our response of sacrificial love
- The only logical response to God's inclusive grace is to become "people of love"
- We are called to offer our bodies as "a living sacrifice" (singular) - one unified body serving together
- Love must be the defining characteristic in all relationships: with fellow believers, governing authorities, and even enemies
- True worship involves laying down our lives in service to others, not thinking of ourselves more highly than we ought
- The principle of overcoming evil with good brings God's presence into difficult situations
- Submission to governing authorities flows from the broader call to love, not blind obedience that contradicts God's commands

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Structure of Romans

Paul's letter follows a clear progression:

- **Chapters 1-3:** Three groups, one problem (all humanity struggles with sin)
- **Chapters 4-8:** Everyone justified by faith (one solution for all)
- **Chapters 9-11:** God chooses to bless and redeem everyone
- **Chapters 12-16:** Therefore, become people of love (practical application)

##### The Potter Metaphor

God as the Potter shapes His vessels (people) for divine use. Just as a potter has authority over clay, God has the right to show grace and mercy to whomever He chooses, including Gentiles who were previously excluded.

##### Body of Christ Unity

All believers, regardless of background, form one body with different functions:

- Different gifts serve the whole (prophecy, serving, teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, showing mercy)
- No group should think themselves superior to others
- Each member belongs to all others and serves for the benefit of the community

##### The Sarx Concept

The "sarx" (Greek for "flesh") represents our animal appetites and selfish desires. Believers must learn to master the sarx and lay down their lives for others, including neighbors, leaders, and enemies.

##### Heaping Burning Coals

The reference to "heaping burning coals" on enemies' heads (Romans 12:20, quoting Proverbs 25:22) is not about passive-aggressive revenge. In Hebrew scripture, burning coals always connect to God's presence. Responding to evil with good brings God's presence into the situation.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Living Sacrifice in Practice

- Serving others according to your gifts rather than seeking personal recognition
- Showing hospitality to those in need, including strangers
- Rejoicing with those who rejoice, mourning with those who mourn
- Blessing those who persecute you instead of cursing them
- Feeding your enemy when hungry, giving drink when thirsty

##### Governing Authority Relationships

- Paying taxes and showing respect even to leaders you disagree with
- Living such a good life that you have nothing to fear from scrutiny
- Recognizing that God can use authorities to accomplish His purposes
- Maintaining civil behavior while still obeying God when human laws conflict with divine commands

##### Church Community Applications

- Using spiritual gifts to build up others rather than promote self
- Avoiding pride and associating with people of "low position"
- Practicing genuine love that hates evil and clings to good
- Maintaining unity despite different backgrounds and functions

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Historical Context of Jewish-Gentile Relations:** Deeper study of the specific tensions Paul was addressing in the Roman church and how they mirror modern unity challenges
2. **Comparative Study of "Therefore" Passages:** Examining other major "therefore" transitions in Paul's letters and their theological significance
3. **Old Testament Foundations:** Investigating the Proverbs and Isaiah passages Paul quotes and their original context
4. **Early Church Persecution:** Understanding how these instructions applied to believers facing Roman opposition and martyrdom
5. **Spiritual Gifts and Community:** Detailed exploration of how the different gifts mentioned function in healthy church communities
6. **Civil Disobedience and Faith:** Studying biblical examples of when believers appropriately resisted governing authorities (Daniel, Hebrew midwives, apostles)

#### Comprehension Questions

1. According to Paul's argument in Romans, what is the "only logical response" to God's mercy toward all humanity, and how does this connect to the first 11 chapters of Romans?

2. What does it mean that believers should offer their bodies as "a living sacrifice" (singular rather than plural), and how does this relate to the concept of the body of Christ?

3. How does the instruction to "heap burning coals" on an enemy's head differ from seeking passive-aggressive revenge, and what does this reveal about God's character?

4. In what ways does Paul's teaching about submitting to governing authorities fit within his broader theme of love, and when might this submission have appropriate limits?

5. How do the various spiritual gifts mentioned (prophecy, serving, teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, showing mercy) work together to demonstrate God's inclusive grace to both Jews and Gentiles?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

BEMA Episode 154 masterfully demonstrates how theology must lead to transformed living. Paul's brilliant "therefore" serves as a hinge between doctrinal foundation and practical application - if God truly shows mercy to all humanity equally, then our only reasonable response is to become conduits of that same love. The episode challenges listeners to move beyond theoretical understanding of grace to embodied sacrifice, whether serving fellow believers, respecting difficult authorities, or even blessing enemies. Most striking is Paul's vision of unity: not uniformity, but diverse gifts working together as one living sacrifice. This isn't just individual piety but corporate worship - our collective love becoming a "pleasing aroma" that shows the world who God really is. The call to overcome evil with good by bringing God's presence into every situation offers a radical alternative to both passive compliance and aggressive resistance.

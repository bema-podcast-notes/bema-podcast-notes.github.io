### BEMA Episode 185: Revelation - Bittersweet Prophecy - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 185 - Revelation: Bittersweet Prophecy
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Revelation 10-11

This episode explores Revelation chapters 10 and 11, examining how John draws heavily from the Old Testament prophets, particularly Ezekiel and Daniel, to communicate messages of hope and perseverance to the early church. The discussion emphasizes how John uses apocalyptic imagery not to predict a distant future, but to encourage believers facing present persecution. The episode demonstrates how understanding the Hebrew scriptures is essential for properly interpreting Revelation's symbolism, including the mighty angel, the little scroll, the two witnesses, and the ongoing battle between Empire and Shalom.

#### Key Takeaways

- Revelation 10-11 is saturated with references to Old Testament apocalyptic literature, especially Ezekiel and Daniel
- The "little scroll" that is sweet to taste but bitter in the stomach directly parallels Ezekiel's commission as a prophet
- John's message is one of encouragement and hope to believers facing immediate persecution, not a roadmap for distant future events
- The "two witnesses" likely represent Moses and Elijah, symbolizing the Law and the Prophets bearing witness to God's Kingdom
- References to doubled numbers (24 elders, two olive trees, two lampstands) point to the unified body of Christ including both Jews and Gentiles
- The apocalyptic imagery communicates that suffering has a definition and an imminent end
- John calls his audience to "prophesy again" - to continue bearing witness despite opposition
- Proper interpretation requires reading Revelation through the lens of Hebrew scripture and first-century cultural context

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Mighty Angel and Old Testament Connections

Revelation 10 opens with "another mighty angel coming down from heaven" who is described with vivid imagery: robed in a cloud, rainbow above his head, face like the sun, legs like fiery pillars. These descriptions are not random but deliberately echo passages from Ezekiel 1, where the prophet describes his vision of God's glory surrounded by a rainbow and radiant light. This connection serves multiple purposes:

1. It validates John's vision by linking it to accepted prophetic tradition
2. It reminds Jewish readers that their ancestors received similar encouragement during exile
3. The rainbow reference recalls God's covenant with Noah, assuring readers that despite apocalyptic destruction, God remembers His promises
4. It establishes continuity between Old and New Testament revelation

The angel stands with one foot on the sea and one on the land, symbolizing authority over all creation. The "little scroll" in his hand becomes the focus of the next section.

##### The Bittersweet Scroll - Ezekiel's Commission Revisited

The command to "take and eat" the scroll directly parallels Ezekiel 3:1-3, where the prophet is told to eat a scroll that tastes sweet as honey. This parallel is intentional and profound:

- In both cases, God's word is sweet to receive but difficult to proclaim
- The sweetness represents the privilege and truth of God's message
- The bitterness (sourness in the stomach) represents the difficulty of delivering hard truths to suffering people
- Ezekiel was sent to "hardened and obstinate" Israelites; John is being commissioned to encourage believers facing persecution

John's use of the Greek word "palin" (again/anew) when he's told "You must prophesy again" emphasizes that this is not a new message but a renewal of ancient prophetic truth. The message needs to be spoken again because:

1. People are suffering and need encouragement
2. God's words are "hard to hear and digest when you are sitting in the heat of oppression and fear"
3. The community needs reminding that their struggle is worth it
4. They need to be told to "overcome" and "run the race marked out for them"

##### Expansion of the Mission to the Gentiles

A crucial difference between Ezekiel's commission and John's is the scope of the audience. Ezekiel was told he was NOT being sent to people of "obscure speech and strange language" but specifically to Israel. In contrast, John must prophesy "about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings." This expansion represents a fundamental shift in God's mission - the inclusion of Gentiles into the covenant community.

##### The Two Witnesses - Moses and Elijah

Revelation 11 introduces "two witnesses" who will prophesy for 1,260 days (three and a half years - half of seven, representing a significant but limited time). Traditional futuristic interpretations have speculated about the identity of these literal individuals who will appear in the end times. However, contextual interpretation reveals:

**Identification as Moses and Elijah:**
- Any first-century Jew would immediately think of Moses and Elijah as the two dominant witnesses in Jewish history
- These two appeared together at the Transfiguration, bearing witness to Jesus' identity and mission
- The powers attributed to the witnesses confirm this identification:
  - Power to shut up heaven so no rain falls (Elijah's miracle in 1 Kings 17)
  - Power to turn water to blood and strike earth with plagues (Moses in Exodus)

**Symbolic Representation:**
- Moses represents the Torah (Law)
- Elijah represents the Prophets
- Together they represent the entire witness of the Hebrew scriptures
- They symbolize how "the Law and the Prophets" testify to God's Kingdom

##### The Two Olive Trees and Two Lampstands

The witnesses are called "the two olive trees and the two lampstands." This imagery connects to:

- Zechariah 4, where olive trees and lampstands represent God's anointed ones
- Olive trees symbolize the community of God's people
- Lampstands represent light-bearing witness in the world

The doubling is significant. Throughout Revelation, John presents doubled numbers where you'd expect single ones:

- 24 elders instead of 12 (representing the 12 tribes + 12 apostles)
- 2 olive trees instead of 1
- 2 lampstands instead of 1

This doubling points to the unified body of Christ composed of both Jews AND Gentiles. The two witnesses therefore represent the entire community of believers - Jew and Gentile together - serving as God's witnesses in the world.

**Implications for believers:**
- The unified body has power beyond what they know
- Their testimony lived out as a people is as powerful as Moses and Elijah's testimony
- They have power to bring life or destruction through their witness

##### The Death and Resurrection of the Witnesses

The witnesses are killed by "the beast that comes up from the abyss" and their bodies lie in "the great city, which is figuratively called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified." This city represents Jerusalem in its corrupted state, aligned with oppressive powers.

**The Pattern:**
1. The witnesses complete their testimony
2. They are killed and left unburied (ultimate dishonor)
3. People from every nation gaze on their bodies and celebrate
4. After three and a half days (half of seven - significant but limited time), they are resurrected
5. The breath of life from God enters them
6. They are taken up to heaven in a cloud (like Elijah)
7. Their enemies witness their vindication

**Contextual Meaning:**
- This mirrors the experience of first-century believers who felt their witness was useless
- Their testimony seemed defeated by persecution and death
- John encourages them that apparent defeat is not final
- Resurrection and vindication will come
- The time of suffering is significant but limited (three and a half, not seven)

This is not a futuristic prediction but a message using past biblical patterns to encourage present suffering: "Your witness may seem defeated, but God will vindicate you, just as He vindicated Elijah and just as Jesus was resurrected and ascended."

##### Measuring the Temple

The chapter begins with John being given a "reed like a measuring rod" and told to measure the temple, altar, and worshipers, but to exclude the outer court "because it has been given to the Gentiles. They will trample on the holy city for 42 months."

This setup repeats the prophecy of Ezekiel 40-42, where the prophet is shown a vision of a new temple being measured. The significance includes:

- 42 months = 3.5 years = 1,260 days (same period the witnesses prophesy)
- Half of seven years = significant but limited time
- The trampling represents persecution and oppression
- The measuring represents preservation - God protects what is His
- The distinction between inner and outer court may represent the protected core of faith vs. external persecution

##### The Seventh Trumpet and Kingdom Victory

The chapter concludes with the seventh trumpet sounding and voices declaring: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign forever and ever."

This brings the discussion back to the central theme of Revelation: the contest between two kingdoms - Empire and Shalom. The 24 elders worship, declaring:

- God has taken His great power and begun to reign
- The time has come for judging the dead
- The time has come for rewarding the prophets and God's people
- The time has come for "destroying those who destroy the earth"

The temple in heaven is opened, revealing the ark of the covenant (symbol of God's presence and faithfulness), accompanied by lightning, thunder, earthquake, and hail - classic theophany imagery indicating God's powerful presence.

##### Apocalyptic Literature and Hermeneutical Training

A recurring emphasis throughout the episode is the need to develop new "hermeneutical neural pathways" for reading Revelation. Most Western Christians were taught to read Revelation as:

- A cryptic prediction of future events
- A timeline for the end times
- Coded messages about modern geopolitics

However, proper apocalyptic interpretation requires understanding:

- The genre conventions of apocalyptic literature
- The heavy use of symbolic numbers (7, 12, 24, 3.5, 42, 1,260)
- The extensive quotation and allusion to Old Testament texts
- The cultural context of first-century believers under Roman persecution
- The primary purpose: to encourage perseverance and hope in present suffering

This requires "redundant training" because it's "such a radically different way of reading Revelation that most of us were handed."

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Context - Persecution and Encouragement

The first-century church faced intense pressure from Roman Empire:

- Social ostracism for refusing to participate in emperor worship
- Economic consequences for not engaging in trade guild religious practices
- Physical persecution including imprisonment and death
- The constant question: "Is our witness worth this suffering?"

John's apocalyptic message spoke directly to this context:

- "Your suffering has a definition and an end"
- "God has not forgotten His covenant promises"
- "Your witness is powerful, like Moses and Elijah"
- "Apparent defeat will turn to vindication and resurrection"
- "The Kingdom of God will prevail over the Empire"

##### Modern Application - Reading Revelation Rightly

Instead of mining Revelation for predictions about helicopters, nuclear war, or the European Union, readers should:

1. Recognize the extensive Old Testament allusions and study those source texts
2. Understand the primary audience's historical situation
3. Hear the message of encouragement to persevere in faithful witness
4. Apply the principles to contemporary contexts of persecution and opposition
5. Take comfort in God's faithfulness to His covenant promises
6. Recognize that the contest between God's Kingdom and worldly empires continues

##### The Unified Witness of Jew and Gentile

The doubled imagery (24 elders, two olive trees, two lampstands) reminds modern readers that:

- The church is composed of Jews and Gentiles united in Christ
- Both groups together form God's witness in the world
- Unity in diversity has always been central to God's mission
- The testimony of Scripture (Law and Prophets) and Spirit work together
- Our witness has power we may not fully recognize

##### The Bittersweet Nature of Prophetic Calling

For anyone called to speak God's truth:

- The message itself is sweet - it's true, beautiful, life-giving
- The delivery can be bitter - it's costly, countercultural, difficult
- Speaking truth to power often results in suffering
- The call is to persevere despite the bitterness
- The promise is that the suffering is limited and will end in vindication

##### Practical Framework for Bible Study

The episode models an approach to Scripture that:

1. Reads Text-to-Text (Revelation to Ezekiel, Daniel, etc.)
2. Reads Text-to-Context (Revelation to first-century persecution)
3. Asks about authorial intent rather than imposing modern frameworks
4. Values the Old Testament as essential for understanding the New
5. Recognizes genre and interprets accordingly
6. Looks for encouragement and application rather than just prediction

#### Summary

BEMA Episode 185 demonstrates that Revelation 10-11 is not a cryptic prediction of distant future events but a powerful message of encouragement to first-century believers facing persecution. John draws extensively from Old Testament prophets, particularly Ezekiel, to communicate that God has not forgotten His people and their suffering will have a definite end.

The little scroll that is sweet to taste but bitter to digest recalls Ezekiel's prophetic commission, reminding readers that proclaiming God's truth is both a privilege and a burden. The command to "prophesy again" emphasizes the renewal of ancient prophetic messages for a new context - now expanded to include Gentiles as full members of God's covenant community.

The two witnesses represent Moses and Elijah - the Law and the Prophets - bearing testimony to God's Kingdom. Their powers (shutting up heaven, turning water to blood) confirm this identification. More broadly, they symbolize the unified witness of Jews and Gentiles together as God's people. The doubling of imagery throughout Revelation (24 elders, two olive trees, two lampstands) reinforces this theme of the unified body of Christ.

The witnesses' death and resurrection pattern mirrors Jesus' experience and provides hope to believers whose witness seems defeated by persecution. The time periods (42 months, 1,260 days, three and a half days) are all variations of "half of seven" - representing significant but limited suffering that will end in vindication.

Ultimately, this passage is about the ongoing contest between Empire and Shalom, with the assurance that "the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah." The call is to persevere in faithful witness, knowing that suffering is temporary and God's Kingdom will prevail. Proper interpretation requires understanding apocalyptic genre, Old Testament background, and first-century cultural context rather than imposing modern futuristic frameworks onto the text.

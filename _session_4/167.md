### BEMA Episode 167: James — Mitzvoth

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 167: James — Mitzvoth    
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings    
**Topic:** An examination of the Book of James, focusing on understanding James as a letter from the Jewish leader of the Jerusalem church to Jewish believers scattered among the Gentile world, emphasizing the distinction between mitzvoth (deeds/works of obedience) and Paul's discussion of works of the law.

This episode establishes the proper context for reading James by identifying the author as James son of Alphaeus (cousin of Jesus and leader of the Jerusalem church), examining the audience (Jewish believers in the diaspora), and clarifying that James is not contradicting Paul but addressing a different concern—the need for Jewish believers to maintain their covenant distinctiveness while living among Gentiles.

#### Key Takeaways

- James, the author, is James son of Alphaeus (cousin of Jesus) who led the Jerusalem church, not necessarily Jesus's biological brother
- The letter addresses Jewish believers scattered among Gentile nations, not a general Christian audience
- James uses "mitzvoth" (deeds/works of obedience) rather than Paul's "ergu nomu" (works of the law that make one Jewish)
- James is not contradicting Paul's message of justification by faith, but addressing Jewish believers' need to maintain covenant obedience
- The book demonstrates sophisticated literary construction, likely featuring chiastic structure and intentional Septuagint references
- James emphasizes that authentic faith must be accompanied by action, particularly in hospitality and treatment of others
- The letter includes significant references to Noah's story, connecting to the Noahic covenant that governs Gentile behavior

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Authorship and Identity of James

The episode clarifies that James, the author, is likely James son of Alphaeus rather than James son of Zebedee or a biological brother of Jesus. Key evidence includes:

- The term "brother" (adelphos) in Hebrew thinking means "kinsman," not necessarily biological sibling
- James son of Alphaeus was part of the inner circle (Peter, James, and John) as likely firstborn sons
- This James became the leader of the Jerusalem church when Peter took charge of the broader Christian movement
- The leadership structure followed Jewish patterns of firstborn inheritance and authority

##### The Three Pillars Structure

Following Jesus's resurrection, leadership was organized around three pillars:

- **Peter:** Leader of the entire Christian movement
- **James (son of Alphaeus):** Leader of the Jewish church in Jerusalem
- **John:** Later became pastor of the churches in Asia

##### Target Audience and Context

James writes specifically "to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations," indicating:

- A distinctly Jewish audience living in Gentile territories
- Jewish believers struggling to maintain their covenant identity in multicultural settings
- The need to address how Jewish believers should relate to Gentile believers and culture

##### Mitzvoth vs. Ergu Nomu

James's discussion of "works" differs fundamentally from Paul's:

- **James uses "mitzvoth":** Hebrew concept of deeds/acts of obedience to God's covenant
- **Paul uses "ergu nomu":** Greek phrase referring to works of the law that make one Jewish (circumcision, dietary laws, etc.)
- **Different conversations:** Paul addressed whether Gentiles needed to become Jewish; James addressed whether Jews should maintain their distinctiveness

##### Literary Sophistication

The episode highlights James's brilliant literary construction:

- Likely features multiple chiastic structures
- Contains intentional references to the Septuagint
- Incorporates sophisticated wordplay and recurring themes
- Uses Noah references to connect with Gentile covenant obligations

#### Examples & Applications

##### Faith and Action Integration

James's central passage (2:14-26) demonstrates faith through:

- **Abraham's example:** His faith was "made complete" by his willingness to sacrifice Isaac
- **Rahab's example:** A Gentile prostitute whose faith led to protective action for God's people
- **Practical care:** Providing actual help to those lacking clothes and food, not just verbal blessings

##### Jewish Distinctiveness in Gentile Culture

James addresses practical challenges Jewish believers faced:

- Maintaining dietary laws and Sabbath observance while living among Gentiles
- Preserving covenant identity without creating walls against Gentile believers
- Demonstrating authentic faith through distinctively Jewish practices of hospitality and righteousness

##### The Tongue and Community Relations

The episode suggests James's central concern may be how Jewish believers spoke about Gentile believers:

- Controlling speech to avoid undermining God's inclusive work
- Practicing hospitality that extends beyond tribal boundaries
- Using words that build unity rather than division

##### Wealth and Social Justice

James's teachings on wealth and poverty reflect Jewish covenant values:

- Equal treatment regardless of economic status
- Preference for the poor and marginalized
- Critique of systems that advantage the wealthy at others' expense

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Chiastic Structure Analysis:** Detailed examination of the various theories about James's literary structure and their implications for interpretation
2. **Septuagint References:** Study of specific Old Testament quotations and allusions in James, particularly connections to Noah's story
3. **First-Century Jewish Diaspora Life:** Investigation of the practical challenges facing Jewish believers in Gentile cities
4. **Comparison with Other Jewish Literature:** Examining James alongside other Second Temple period Jewish writings on wisdom and practical righteousness
5. **Early Church Leadership Dynamics:** Deeper study of the relationship between James, Paul, and Peter in the Jerusalem Council and beyond
6. **Ancient Hospitality Customs:** Understanding the cultural expectations and religious significance of hospitality in the ancient Near East

1. How does understanding James as the son of Alphaeus rather than the son of Zebedee or biological brother of Jesus change your interpretation of his authority and perspective in writing this letter?

2. What is the significance of James addressing "the twelve tribes scattered among the nations" rather than a general Christian audience, and how does this context affect the meaning of his teachings?

3. Explain the difference between James's use of "mitzvoth" and Paul's use of "ergu nomu" in their respective discussions of works and faith. Why is this distinction crucial for understanding their relationship?

4. How does James's use of both Abraham and Rahab as examples of faith in action demonstrate his message to both Jewish and Gentile believers? What point is he making by including both?

5. According to the episode's analysis, what might be the central concern of James's letter regarding the relationship between Jewish and Gentile believers, and how does this relate to the discussion of controlling the tongue?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

BEMA Episode 167 provides essential context for reading the Book of James by establishing its proper historical and theological framework. Rather than seeing James as contradicting Paul's message of justification by faith, we discover two leaders addressing complementary concerns within the early church. James, as the Jewish leader in Jerusalem, writes to Jewish believers struggling to maintain their covenant identity while living among Gentiles, emphasizing that authentic faith naturally expresses itself through mitzvoth—acts of obedience that demonstrate covenant relationship with God.

The episode's most valuable insight is recognizing that James and Paul are having different conversations entirely. While Paul addresses whether Gentiles need to become Jewish to follow Jesus, James addresses whether Jews should maintain their distinctiveness while embracing God's inclusive work among the Gentiles. This understanding resolves centuries of apparent theological tension and reveals both authors as advocating for authentic, lived-out faith—Paul emphasizing faith over Jewish identity markers for Gentiles, James emphasizing covenant obedience as the natural fruit of faith for Jews.

The sophisticated literary construction of James, with its likely chiastic structure and intentional biblical references, demonstrates that this is not a simple ethical treatise but a carefully crafted theological argument. James's central concern appears to be maintaining unity in the early church while preserving the distinctiveness that each group brings to the body of Christ. His message remains profoundly relevant: authentic faith must be incarnated in action, hospitality must extend beyond tribal boundaries, and our speech must build rather than divide the community of faith.

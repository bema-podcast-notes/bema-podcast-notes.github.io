### BEMA Episode 160: Colossians - Gnostic Heresy

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode examines Paul's letter to the Colossians, addressing a unique challenge that threatened this small church community through the influence of Gnostic philosophy. Marty Solomon and Brent Billings explore how Paul confronts dangerous teachings rooted in Platonic dualism that divided spiritual and physical reality, creating an elitist system of "enlightened" individuals who either completely denied the value of physical existence or pursued extreme asceticism to achieve spiritual purity. The city of Colossae, located off the main road between Hieropolis and Laodicea, was destroyed by earthquakes in the AD 60s and never successfully rebuilt, leaving it today as an unexcavated archaeological site. Despite Colossae's physical destruction, Paul's letter remains a powerful refutation of Gnostic dualism and a compelling defense of the goodness of creation and the incarnation of Christ. The episode demonstrates how Paul systematically dismantles Gnostic philosophy by emphasizing Christ's full divinity dwelling in bodily form and the reconciliation of all things - both spiritual and physical - through the cross.

#### Key Takeaways

- Colossians mirrors the structure of Ephesians with theology (orthodoxy) in the first half and practical living (orthopraxy) in the second half, but addresses the specific threat of Gnostic philosophy in Colossae
- Gnostic dualism created two dangerous extremes: either complete disregard for the physical body (leading to moral libertinism) or extreme asceticism and self-denial (creating spiritual elitism)
- Paul deliberately uses inclusive language about Christ's incarnation and reconciliation, emphasizing "all things" both "in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible" to counter Gnostic dualism
- The Platonic idea that this world is merely "shadows" of a perfect spiritual realm has unfortunately influenced much Christian thinking about heaven and earthly existence
- Paul's response to Gnostic "enlightenment" is that true wisdom and knowledge are available to all people through Christ, not reserved for a spiritual elite
- The false humility and angel worship mentioned in Colossians represent sophisticated forms of spiritual pride disguised as advanced religious practice
- Paul argues that Christ has already dealt with sin and spiritual powers through the cross, making Gnostic self-denial and ascetic practices unnecessary and ineffective
- The "do not handle, do not taste, do not touch" rules represent human-made regulations that appear wise but lack any real power to transform lives or restrain sin

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Historical Context of Colossae

The small city of Colossae was positioned off the main road connecting the more prominent cities of Hieropolis and Laodicea. Unlike these larger urban centers, Colossae lacked the political and economic importance that would have warranted rebuilding after the devastating earthquakes of the AD 60s. This historical reality provides a poignant backdrop - the physical city that received one of Paul's letters disappeared within decades, yet the spiritual truths Paul communicated continue to speak to challenges the church faces today. The unexcavated nature of the site means much of what we know about Colossae comes from scattered archaeological finds and currency rather than systematic excavation.

##### Platonic Philosophy and the Theory of Forms

The episode emphasizes understanding Plato's theory of forms as foundational to Gnostic thought. According to Plato, the material world consists of mere shadows or imperfect copies of perfect forms that exist in a spiritual realm. This creates a fundamental dualism where spiritual reality is considered superior, pure, and eternal, while physical reality is inferior, corrupt, and temporary. The famous allegory of the cave illustrates how most people live in ignorance of true reality, seeing only shadows on the wall, while the "enlightened" few escape to discover the perfect world of forms. This philosophical framework profoundly influenced Gnostic movements and, as the hosts argue, has unfortunately shaped much Christian thinking about heaven and earthly existence.

##### The Two Branches of Gnostic Response to Dualism

Gnostic dualism manifested in two contrasting behavioral extremes, both equally dangerous to Christian faith and practice. The first extreme concluded that since spiritual reality alone mattered, physical actions were irrelevant - leading to moral libertinism where adherents could "eat whatever, do whatever, engage whatever" without spiritual consequence because "the real action is somewhere else." The second extreme, likely more prevalent in sophisticated Colossae, pursued spiritual advancement through extreme asceticism and self-denial, believing that denying physical pleasures and needs would enable them to transcend material existence and achieve spiritual enlightenment. Both responses flow from the same false premise that divides spiritual and physical reality into competing realms.

##### Paul's Christological Response to Dualism

Paul's counter-argument to Gnostic dualism centers on the incarnation and the cosmic scope of Christ's work. He deliberately emphasizes that Christ is "the image of the invisible God" in whom "all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form." This language directly confronts the Gnostic separation of spiritual and physical by asserting that divine fullness dwelt completely in the physical body of Jesus. Paul's repeated use of "all things" language - creation, sustenance, and reconciliation of "all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven" - systematically dismantles any dualistic division between spiritual and physical realms. The incarnation becomes not just a theological doctrine but a fundamental refutation of Gnostic philosophy.

##### The False Appeal of Ascetic Spirituality

Paul addresses the seductive nature of ascetic practices that "indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body." These practices appeal to religious sensibilities because they seem to demonstrate superior spiritual commitment and self-control. However, Paul argues they "lack any value in restraining sinful indulgence" and represent human-made regulations rather than divine truth. The rules "do not handle, do not taste, do not touch" create an appearance of advanced spirituality while actually representing a fundamental misunderstanding of how spiritual transformation occurs.

##### The Problem of Spiritual Elitism

Gnostic systems inherently created spiritual hierarchies where the "enlightened" few possessed special knowledge unavailable to ordinary believers. Paul confronts this elitism by asserting that the "treasures of wisdom and knowledge" hidden in Christ are available to all, not reserved for a spiritual elite. He warns against those who "go into great detail about what they have seen" and are "puffed up with idle notions by their unspiritual mind," identifying the pride that often disguises itself as advanced spiritual experience. Paul's democratization of spiritual wisdom challenges any system that creates insider and outsider categories among believers.

##### The Present Reality of God's Kingdom

Against Gnostic escapism, Paul emphasizes the present reality of spiritual transformation. He declares that God "has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the Kingdom of the Son he loves" - using past tense to indicate completed action rather than future hope. This counters the Gnostic view that salvation consists of escaping physical existence. Instead, Paul presents a vision where believers are called to "live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way, bearing fruit in every good work" in this physical world, not in some other spiritual realm.

##### The Critique of Contemporary Christian Platonism

The episode argues that much contemporary Christian thinking has been unconsciously shaped by Platonic rather than biblical categories. The common Christian notion of heaven as "some perfect platonic place, other dimension" represents Greek philosophical influence rather than biblical teaching. This Platonic strain creates the false impression that Christians are "spirits trapped in prisons of flesh, walking in a world that is doomed to destruction, just waiting for 'some glad morning when this life is o'er'" - a perspective that undermines engagement with present physical reality and contradicts the biblical vision of God's Kingdom operating "here, now, deeply engaged with this world of flesh and blood, soil and spirit."

#### Examples & Applications

##### Recognizing Contemporary Gnostic Tendencies

Modern Christianity often reflects Gnostic dualism in various forms, from extreme ascetic practices that view physical pleasure as inherently sinful to spiritual elitism that creates hierarchies based on special experiences or knowledge. Some contemporary expressions include movements that emphasize escape from worldly engagement, create insider/outsider dynamics based on spiritual experiences, or suggest that true spirituality requires rejection of physical creation and embodied existence.

##### The Balance of Physical and Spiritual Life

Paul's critique of both libertine and ascetic responses to dualism provides guidance for healthy Christian living that neither dismisses physical reality as irrelevant nor treats it as inherently evil. This challenges both prosperity theology (which may overemphasize physical blessing) and ascetic spirituality (which may undervalue God's good creation) in favor of integrated living that honors both body and spirit as God's creation.

##### Engaging Culture Without Elitism

Paul's emphasis on wisdom and knowledge being available to all believers through Christ challenges contemporary tendencies toward spiritual elitism, whether based on education, experience, or theological sophistication. True Christian wisdom is accessible to all rather than reserved for those with special training or mystical experiences.

##### The Goodness of Creation and Embodied Existence

Against Gnostic devaluation of physical reality, Paul's teaching affirms the goodness of creation and the importance of embodied existence. This supports Christian engagement with issues like environmental stewardship, physical health, social justice, and cultural participation rather than otherworldly escapism.

##### Discerning False Spiritual Practices

Paul's warning about practices that "have an appearance of wisdom" but "lack any value in restraining sinful indulgence" provides criteria for evaluating contemporary spiritual practices. The test is not whether something appears sophisticated or demanding, but whether it actually produces spiritual transformation and aligns with biblical truth.

##### The Danger of Adding Human Rules to Gospel Freedom

The "do not handle, do not taste, do not touch" mentality appears in various forms throughout Christian history, from medieval monasticism to modern legalism. Paul's critique challenges any system that adds human-made regulations to the Gospel, whether ascetic practices, dietary restrictions, or behavioral codes that go beyond biblical teaching.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### The Historical Development of Gnosticism

Investigation into the various forms of Gnostic thought in the first and second centuries, including their relationship to Jewish mysticism, Greek philosophy, and Christian theology, would provide deeper context for understanding Paul's specific concerns in Colossians.

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does Paul's use of inclusive language ("all things, visible and invisible, in heaven and on earth") specifically counter Gnostic dualism, and what does this suggest about the scope of Christ's work and authority?

2. What are the two extreme behavioral responses to Gnostic dualism that Paul addresses, and how do both flow from the same false philosophical foundation about the relationship between spiritual and physical reality?

3. How does Paul's emphasis on the "fullness of the Deity" dwelling in Christ "in bodily form" serve as both theological truth and philosophical refutation of Gnostic thought?

4. What specific evidence suggests that the Colossians were dealing with the ascetic rather than libertine form of Gnosticism, and how does Paul's response address the appeal of self-denial as spiritual practice?

5. In what ways has Platonic philosophy influenced contemporary Christian thinking about heaven, spirituality, and engagement with physical creation, and how does this differ from the biblical vision Paul presents?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This episode exposes the subtle but dangerous influence of Gnostic philosophy on early Christianity and its continued impact on contemporary faith. Paul's letter to the small, ultimately doomed city of Colossae addresses a sophisticated form of spiritual elitism that created false hierarchies between enlightened and ordinary believers while fundamentally misunderstanding the relationship between spiritual and physical reality. The Gnostic division of existence into superior spiritual and inferior physical realms led to two equally destructive responses: either complete disregard for physical behavior or extreme asceticism designed to transcend material existence. Paul's response centers on the incarnation of Christ, emphasizing that divine fullness dwelt completely in bodily form and that Christ's work encompasses the reconciliation of all things, both spiritual and physical. His critique of ascetic practices that "have an appearance of wisdom" but "lack any value" challenges contemporary tendencies toward spiritual elitism and human-made religious regulations. Perhaps most significantly, the episode reveals how much contemporary Christian thinking has been shaped by Platonic rather than biblical categories, creating an otherworldly spirituality that views earth as a prison to escape rather than God's good creation to engage. Paul's vision presents Christianity as deeply committed to this world of "flesh and blood, soil and spirit" where God's Kingdom operates in the present rather than offering escape to some perfect spiritual realm. The destroyed city of Colossae serves as a poignant reminder that while human institutions may fade, the spiritual truths Paul communicated continue to address the perennial human tendency to create false divisions between sacred and secular, spiritual and physical, enlightened and ordinary - challenging believers to embrace the integrated wholeness that comes through Christ's complete work of reconciliation.

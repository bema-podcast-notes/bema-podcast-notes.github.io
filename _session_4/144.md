### BEMA Episode 144: Galatians — Paul's Gospel

#### Study Notes

##### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Podcast Episode 144: "Galatians — Paul's Gospel"**  
Hosts: Marty Solomon and Brent Billings

This episode begins a verse-by-verse study of Paul's letter to the Galatians, focusing specifically on Chapter 1. The discussion centers on understanding Paul's Gospel as a direct revelation from Jesus Christ rather than human teaching, and explores the historical and cultural context of the Galatian churches, particularly the challenges faced by God-fearing Gentiles (theosebes) in a region dominated by conservative Jewish thought.

##### Key Takeaways

- **Paul's Gospel was received directly from Jesus Christ, not through human teaching or the other apostles**
- **Galatians is likely Paul's earliest letter, written before the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15**
- **The Gospel is fundamentally inclusive, breaking down barriers between Jews and Gentiles**
- **The Galatian context involved intense pressure for Gentile converts to fully convert to Judaism**
- **Paul spent three years in Arabia and Damascus being taught by Jesus before consulting other apostles**
- **The "Jewish exception" from emperor worship created additional motivation for Gentiles to convert to Judaism**
- **Paul's authority came from his direct calling and revelation, not from his impressive rabbinic credentials under Gamaliel**

##### Main Concepts & Theories

**The New Perspective on Paul**  
The episode heavily references the "New Perspective on Paul" scholarship, particularly citing scholars like N.T. Wright, James Dunn, E.P. Sanders, and Mark D. Nanos. This perspective challenges traditional Protestant interpretations of Paul's letters, focusing more on the historical and cultural context of Paul's ministry to Gentiles rather than abstract theological concepts about individual salvation.

**Theosebes (God-Fearing Gentiles)**  
In the diaspora Jewish communities, especially in regions like Galatia, there existed a category of Gentiles who were attracted to Judaism and worshipped the God of Israel without fully converting. These "God-fearers" found themselves in a precarious position, especially in conservative regions influenced by the school of Shammai, which required full conversion for inclusion in the Jewish community.

**The Shammai vs. Hillel Debate**  
The episode explains how Galatia was dominated by the ultra-conservative perspective of Rabbi Shammai, who insisted that Gentiles must fully convert to Judaism to be part of God's people. This contrasted with the more moderate view of Hillel, who allowed for some level of inclusion without full conversion, though still not as full siblings in the family of Abraham.

**The Jewish Exception**  
A historical arrangement between Herod the Great and Caesar exempted Jews from emperor worship in exchange for daily sacrifices offered "for" (not "to") the emperor. This created a powerful incentive for God-fearing Gentiles to convert to Judaism, as refusal to worship Caesar was a capital offense for non-Jews.

**Paul's Unique Calling and Authority**  
Paul establishes his authority not through his impressive credentials as a student of Gamaliel, but through his direct encounter with the risen Christ and three years of personal instruction. This creates a parallel with the other apostles' three-year training with Jesus during his earthly ministry.

##### Examples & Applications

**Historical Context of Religious Pressure**  
The episode provides a vivid picture of the life-and-death decisions faced by early Gentile believers. When Roman authorities demanded emperor worship, Jews could claim exemption, but Gentile Christians faced martyrdom or apostasy. This helps explain why the temptation to convert to Judaism was so strong in places like Galatia.

**Modern Application of Gospel Inclusivity**  
Marty Solomon connects Paul's message to contemporary discussions about inclusion in Christian communities. He argues that the Gospel has always been fundamentally inclusive, fighting for people's access to God's table, while distinguishing this from universalism.

**Paul's Educational Journey**  
The episode illustrates Paul's humility in setting aside his prestigious rabbinical education under Gamaliel (compared to having a "PhD from Harvard") to learn from Jesus directly. This demonstrates the radical nature of his conversion and calling.

**The Book Recommendation Framework**  
The detailed discussion of Thomas Lancaster's "The Holy Epistle to the Galatians" provides a model for critical engagement with scholarly resources, showing how to appreciate valuable scholarship while maintaining discernment about theological conclusions.

##### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

**The Jerusalem Council and Its Timing**  
The episode mentions that Galatians was written before Acts 15, but doesn't fully explore the implications of this timing for understanding the development of early Christian theology and practice.

**The Nature of Paul's Arabian Experience**  
Paul's three years in Arabia receiving direct instruction from Jesus raises questions about the nature of this revelation and how it compares to mystical experiences in other religious traditions.

**The Relationship Between Judaism and Early Christianity**  
The complex dynamics between Jewish believers, Gentile converts, and traditional Judaism in the first century deserve deeper exploration, particularly regarding how the early church navigated identity and community boundaries.

**Messianic Judaism and Biblical Interpretation**  
The episode touches on contemporary Messianic Jewish interpretation of Paul's letters, suggesting an area for further study regarding how different Jewish Christian communities understand Torah observance today.

**The Sociology of Religious Conversion**  
The pressures faced by Gentile believers in Galatia provide a case study for understanding how social, political, and religious factors influence religious conversion and community belonging.

##### Comprehension Questions

1. **Why does Marty Solomon believe that Galatians was written before the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15, and what evidence does he provide for this timing?**

2. **How did the "Jewish exception" from emperor worship create additional pressure for God-fearing Gentiles to convert to Judaism, and what does this reveal about the intersection of religion and politics in the first century?**

3. **What is the significance of Paul spending three years in Arabia and Damascus before consulting with the other apostles, and how does this parallel the experience of Jesus' other disciples?**

4. **How does the school of Shammai's influence in Galatia help explain the particular challenges faced by Gentile believers in that region?**

5. **In what ways does Paul's argument for Gospel inclusivity challenge both ancient Jewish exclusivity and modern Christian exclusivity, and how does Solomon distinguish this from universalism?**

##### Brief Personalized Summary

BEMA Episode 144 provides a masterful introduction to Paul's letter to the Galatians by grounding it firmly in its historical context. The episode's strength lies in its detailed explanation of the social and religious pressures facing first-century Gentile believers, particularly the life-and-death stakes involved in choosing between conversion to Judaism and potential martyrdom for refusing emperor worship.

Marty Solomon's emphasis on the "New Perspective on Paul" scholarship offers a refreshing alternative to traditional Protestant readings that often abstract Paul's letters from their historical context. The discussion of theosebes (God-fearing Gentiles) and the Shammai-Hillel debate illuminates why Paul's message of radical inclusion was so revolutionary and controversial in places like Galatia.

The episode also demonstrates excellent scholarly engagement through its detailed review of Thomas Lancaster's commentary, showing how to appreciate valuable research while maintaining critical discernment. Paul's three-year period of direct instruction from Jesus emerges as a crucial foundation for his apostolic authority, paralleling the training of the other apostles and establishing the divine origin of his Gospel to the Gentiles.

Most significantly, the episode challenges listeners to grapple with the inclusive nature of the Gospel while maintaining theological integrity, offering a framework for understanding how Paul's first-century message speaks to contemporary issues of community, belonging, and religious identity.

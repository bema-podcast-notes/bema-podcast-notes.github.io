### BEMA 176: Revelation - Smyrna and Their Crown

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 176 - Revelation: Smyrna and Their Crown
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Revelation 2:8-11 - The letter to the church in Smyrna

This episode continues the exploration of apocalyptic literature by examining the second of the seven letters in Revelation, addressed to the church in Smyrna. The hosts demonstrate how understanding the historical and cultural context of first-century Smyrna illuminates the specific encouragements and warnings John gives to this persecuted community. The letter addresses themes of death, resurrection, poverty, persecution, and faithful endurance in a city known for its loyalty to Rome and its unique cultural characteristics.

#### Key Takeaways

- Apocalyptic literature uses pictures and images to convey a message of hope to the present day, not primarily to predict distant future events
- The letter to Smyrna makes perfect sense when read in light of the city's historical, cultural, and economic context
- Smyrna was named after myrrh, one of its major exports, used primarily in preparing dead bodies
- The city had an unusual infatuation with death and resurrection, combined with being a center of medicine and pagan resurrection cults
- Smyrna showed exceptional loyalty to Rome, making life extremely difficult for believers who refused to worship Caesar
- A Jewish contingent in Smyrna had written to Rome declaring that Gentile converts were not true Jews, removing their protection from emperor worship
- The imagery in the letter (death/resurrection, poverty/riches, crowns, second death) directly corresponds to Smyrna's cultural context
- The "synagogue of Satan" reference is not a blanket statement about Judaism but specifically addresses Jews who rejected Gentile inclusion
- John's method is to teach how to engage Revelation, not just give all the answers, taking "baby steps" to build understanding

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Apocalyptic Literature Definition

Apocalyptic literature is "the use of pictures and images to convey a message of hope to the present day." This definition, established in Session 2 of BEMA, remains foundational for understanding Revelation. The book was written to encourage first-century believers in their immediate circumstances, using symbolic language they would understand.

##### The Hermeneutical Method for Revelation

Marty introduces a consistent format for studying the letters to the seven churches:

1. **Context is everything** - Examine the geographical, historical, cultural, and economic context of each city
2. **Connect the text to context** - Identify how specific phrases in the letter relate to the city's unique characteristics
3. **Understand the original message** - Determine what the letter would have meant to its first recipients

This approach prioritizes understanding what the text meant to its original audience before considering any application to later times.

##### Historical Context of Smyrna

**Geography and Economics:**
- Ancient port city on the coast of Asia Minor (modern-day Izmir, Turkey)
- Major trade hub alongside Pergamum and Ephesus on the coastal route
- Cultural center of Asia in the third century BC, before Ephesus rose to prominence
- Known for wealth and sophisticated urban culture

**Cultural Characteristics:**
- Named after myrrh (smyrna), a major export used in preparing dead bodies
- Unusual infatuation with death and the concept of resurrection
- Center of medicine combining early science with superstition
- Higher concentration of pagan cults focused on resurrection myths
- Known for using crowns to distinguish social classes (wreaths, bronze, silver, gold)
- Historical references to Smyrna's "crown of Porticoes" (city center)

**Political Situation:**
- Formed a formal relationship with Rome in the third century BC when threatened by Antiochus of Syria
- Maintained exceptional loyalty to Rome throughout the Empire's rise
- Created the cult of Roma (goddess personifying Rome) to strengthen bonds with the Empire
- More emphatic about emperor worship than most other cities in Asia

**Religious Context:**
- Strong Jewish community that, unusually, rejected the inclusion of Gentile converts
- These Jews had written to Rome declaring Gentile believers were not true Jews
- This removed the Gentile believers from the Jewish exemption that allowed Jews to avoid Caesar worship
- Resulted in severe persecution and economic hardship for Gentile Christians

##### Persecution and Poverty of Smyrna Believers

The combination of Smyrna's loyalty to Rome and the Jewish community's rejection created a perfect storm of persecution:

1. **Economic Exclusion** - Refusing to affirm Caesar worship made commerce extremely difficult
2. **Loss of Jewish Protection** - Gentile believers lost the exemption Jews enjoyed from emperor worship
3. **Social Pressure** - In a wealthy, class-conscious city, believers lived in poverty
4. **Physical Danger** - Threat of imprisonment and martyrdom for refusing to compromise

##### Analysis of Revelation 2:8-11

**"Him who is the first and the last who died and came to life again"**
- Direct reference to Smyrna's infatuation with death and resurrection
- Points to Jesus as the true example of resurrection, not pagan myths
- Establishes Jesus' authority over death itself

**"I know your afflictions and your poverty, yet you are rich"**
- Acknowledges the economic struggle of believers in a wealthy city
- Contrasts physical poverty with spiritual richness
- Validates their suffering while affirming their true status

**"The slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan"**
- NOT a blanket condemnation of Judaism
- Specifically addresses Jews who rejected Gentile inclusion
- Echoes Paul's teaching that the essence of being Jewish is being a light to the Gentiles (Romans 9-11)
- Similar to Jesus calling Peter "Satan" when he opposed God's purposes
- Reverses the accusation: those excluding Gentiles are not truly Jewish

**"The devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for 10 days"**
- Acknowledges coming persecution
- "10 days" likely symbolic (completeness: 7+3) rather than literal
- Represents a complete period of suffering within community
- Apocalyptic use of numbers to tell a story

**"Be faithful, even to the point of death and I will give you life as your victor's crown"**
- References Smyrna's cultural use of crowns to denote status
- Promises a crown of life (eternal reward) versus earthly status symbols
- Encourages faithfulness unto martyrdom
- Ironic prophetic connection to Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna and disciple of John, martyred in 156 AD

**"The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all by the second death"**
- To a city infatuated with death, introduces the concept of a "second death"
- Shifts focus from physical death to spiritual/eternal death
- Promises that faithful believers will avoid eternal judgment
- Offers hope that perseverance leads to ultimate victory

##### Jewish Numerology in Apocalyptic Literature

The use of symbolic numbers thrives in apocalyptic literature:

- **10** - Represents completeness (7+3), possibly suffering in the midst of community
- **1000** - Multiples represent periods of time or complete epochs
- Numbers tell stories rather than providing precise chronological data
- This symbolic use will continue throughout Revelation (e.g., the millennium)

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Example: Polycarp of Smyrna

Polycarp (c. 69-156 AD) served as Bishop of Smyrna and was a direct disciple of the Apostle John. His martyrdom demonstrates the reality of the persecution John warned about:

- Refused to deny Christ despite threats
- Told his Roman accusers he had served Christ for 86 years and Christ had never wronged him
- When they attempted to burn him, witnesses reported the flames forming a dome around him
- Finally killed by stabbing
- His story exemplifies the "faithful unto death" encouragement of Revelation 2:10

This connection shows how John's letter was not abstract prophecy but addressed real, ongoing persecution that would continue in Smyrna for generations.

##### Cultural Translation Example: Understanding "Synagogue of Satan"

Without historical context, this phrase has been (mis)used as anti-Semitic ammunition. Proper understanding reveals:

- **Misreading:** A condemnation of all Jews or Judaism
- **Contextual reading:** A specific rebuke of Jews in Smyrna who betrayed Gentile believers to Rome
- **Theological foundation:** Builds on Paul's teaching that true Judaism includes being a light to the Gentiles
- **Practical impact:** These particular Jews were actively causing believers to be persecuted and martyred

This example demonstrates why context is essential for responsible interpretation.

##### Economic Reality: Commerce and Confession

Daily life in Smyrna required regular affirmations of Caesar's divinity:

- Market transactions often involved oaths or sacrifices to the emperor
- Guild membership (necessary for many trades) required participation in emperor worship
- Refusing these practices meant economic exclusion
- Believers chose poverty over prosperity when the cost was denying Christ
- The promise "you are rich" spiritually sustained them through material lack

##### Literary Method: Pictures and Images for Present Hope

Each element of the letter functions as encouragement:

1. **Recognition** - "I know your afflictions" - They are seen
2. **Reversal** - "You are rich" - God's perspective differs from Rome's
3. **Justice** - Those who oppose them are judged
4. **Warning** - Suffering will continue
5. **Promise** - Endurance leads to eternal reward
6. **Hope** - The second death won't touch them

This structure provides hope to sustain believers through present suffering, not escapist fantasies about the distant future.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Comparative Study of the Seven Churches** - How does Smyrna's letter compare and contrast with the other six churches in Revelation 2-3? What patterns emerge?

2. **Jewish-Gentile Relations in First-Century Asia Minor** - Why was Smyrna's Jewish community an exception in rejecting Gentile inclusion? What was happening in other cities?

3. **Emperor Worship and Daily Life** - What did practical emperor worship look like in different contexts (markets, guilds, courts, festivals)? How did believers navigate these situations?

4. **The Historical Development of Smyrna** - Trace the city's relationship with Rome from the third century BC through the first century AD. How did political alliances shape culture?

5. **Polycarp and Second-Century Christianity** - Study Polycarp's letters and martyrdom account. How did John's teachings influence his disciple?

6. **Apocalyptic Literature in Second Temple Judaism** - What other apocalyptic writings existed? How would first-century Jews have been trained to read this genre?

7. **Economic Persecution of Early Christians** - Research the economic impact of refusing participation in pagan/imperial cult practices across the Roman Empire

8. **The Theology of Martyrdom in Early Christianity** - How did early Christians understand martyrdom? What theological foundations supported their willingness to die?

9. **Crowns in Greco-Roman Culture** - Investigate the various types of crowns, their social significance, and their use in Smyrna specifically

10. **The Concept of "Second Death" in Jewish and Christian Thought** - Trace this theological idea through Scripture and early Jewish writings

11. **Medical Practices in First-Century Smyrna** - What did the "center of medicine" mean in this context? How did medical practice intersect with religion?

12. **Myrrh Trade and Ancient Commerce** - Study the significance of myrrh in the ancient world, trade routes, and economic impact

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does understanding Smyrna's historical loyalty to Rome and economic dependence on trade help explain why the believers there experienced such severe poverty and persecution?

2. Why is the phrase "synagogue of Satan" NOT a blanket condemnation of Judaism, and what specific historical situation was John addressing with this strong language?

3. In what ways do the specific images John uses in the letter to Smyrna (death/resurrection, crowns, second death, poverty/riches) connect directly to the cultural context of the city?

4. What is the definition of apocalyptic literature, and how does understanding this genre help us interpret Revelation more accurately than reading it primarily as a prediction of future end-times events?

5. How does the later martyrdom of Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna and disciple of John, demonstrate that John's letter addressed real and ongoing persecution rather than symbolic or distant concerns?

#### Summary

This episode demonstrates that Revelation becomes clear and powerful when we understand the original context. The letter to Smyrna was not a cryptic message about the distant future but a direct encouragement to believers facing severe persecution in a city uniquely hostile to Christianity.

Smyrna's exceptional loyalty to Rome, combined with a Jewish community that had betrayed Gentile believers by declaring them non-Jews, created life-threatening conditions. Economic exclusion, social pressure, and physical danger were daily realities. Yet John's letter speaks hope into this darkness using images the Smyrnan believers would immediately recognize: their city's infatuation with death now met by Jesus who died and rose again; their earthly poverty contrasted with spiritual richness; their suffering leading not to the death they knew about, but away from a "second death" they should truly fear; and a promise that faithfulness unto death would earn them a victor's crown far greater than any earthly status symbol.

The method Marty models is crucial: context is everything. By taking baby steps to understand historical, cultural, and economic realities, we learn to read Revelation as its original recipients did - as a message of hope for their present suffering, written in pictures and images they could understand. This approach honors the text, prevents misinterpretation, and reveals the pastoral heart behind John's apocalyptic vision. The letter to Smyrna made perfect sense to them, and when we do the work to understand their world, it makes perfect sense to us too.

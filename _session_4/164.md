**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Topic:** This episode examines Paul's personal letter to Philemon regarding the runaway slave Onesimus, exploring the cultural context of Roman citizenship and slavery, while highlighting Paul's humor and approach to faith-based obedience versus law-based compliance. The letter demonstrates the transformative power of viewing relationships through the lens of God's kingdom rather than worldly social hierarchies.

#### Key Takeaways

- Paul's letter to Philemon is filled with deliberate humor and sarcasm, showing his confidence in Philemon's character

- The letter demonstrates "faith works" versus "law works" - doing right because it's good, not from fear of consequences
- Paul publicly addresses this private matter by copying the entire Colossian church, creating social pressure for reconciliation
- The transformation from "slave" to "brother" reflects the radical nature of kingdom relationships
- Paul's approach shows confidence that people will do the right thing when reminded of their true identity in Christ

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Roman Citizenship and Social Hierarchy

Roman citizenship was extremely difficult to obtain and carried significant privileges. There were only three ways to become a Roman citizen:

**Birth to Citizen Parents:** Unlike modern citizenship by birth location, Roman citizenship required both parents to already be citizens. Conquered peoples were intentionally denied citizenship.

**Surrender Treaty:** If a nation willingly surrendered to Rome (rather than being conquered), citizenship could be part of the agreement.

**Purchase:** Wealthy individuals could buy citizenship, as referenced in Acts where a Roman guard tells Paul, "I had to buy my citizenship."

**Manumission:** The most relevant path for understanding Paul's background - exceptional slaves could be freed (manumitted) by their masters, and their children would receive Roman citizenship. Church tradition suggests Paul's parents were manumitted slaves, explaining his citizenship despite being a Jew from Tarsus.

##### Social Classes in the Roman Empire

The Roman social hierarchy included several distinct levels:

**Above the Citizen Line:**

- Senators (highest wealth level)
- Epicureans (very wealthy)
- Decureans (1 million sesterces minimum)
- Freeborn (born citizens)

**Below the Citizen Line:**

- Freedmen (free but not citizens)
- Slaves

##### The Slave System and Onesimus's Situation

Roman slavery was brutal, and runaway slaves faced execution. However, slaves had limited legal options:

1. **Flight:** Simply run away (usually unsuccessful)
2. **Legal Appeal:** Plead their case to Roman courts (rarely successful)
3. **Patronage:** Seek protection from a Roman citizen willing to advocate for them

Onesimus chose the third option, traveling to Rome to find Paul and use his citizenship status for protection. This was not an escape attempt but a strategic legal maneuver.

##### The Practice of Sublatus (Child Exposure)

Roman society practiced sublatus - abandoning unwanted babies in designated fields outside cities. Professional slave traders would collect healthy, non-defective children, raise them in cage-like conditions, and sell them as slaves when they matured. The name "Onesimus" means "useful" in Greek, suggesting he may have been a product of this system, given a name designed to make him attractive to buyers.

##### Law Works vs. Faith Works

This fundamental Jewish philosophical debate about motivation for obedience appears throughout Paul's writings:

**Law Works:** Obeying rules to avoid punishment or negative consequences (like following speed limits to avoid tickets)

**Faith Works:** Obeying because you believe it's the right thing that leads to flourishing (like following speed limits because they promote safety and order)

Paul consistently advocates for faith works throughout his letters, believing that people should do right because they understand it leads to better outcomes, not from fear of punishment.

##### The Patronage System

Roman society operated on networks of mutual obligation where higher-status individuals provided protection and advancement to lower-status clients in exchange for services and loyalty. Paul uses this system on behalf of Onesimus, leveraging his apostolic authority and relationship with Philemon.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Paul's Humor and Rhetorical Strategy

The letter is filled with tongue-in-cheek elements:

- **Public Pressure:** By addressing the letter to the entire Colossian church, Paul ensures Philemon must read it publicly and respond before witnesses
- **Excessive Flattery:** Paul lays on thick praise about Philemon's character and generosity
- **False Humility:** Describing himself as "an old man and prisoner" while making demands
- **Wordplay:** Using Onesimus's name meaning "useful" to joke about how he was "useless" but is now "useful"
- **Emotional Manipulation:** Calling Onesimus "my very heart" and mentioning his own imprisonment

##### Historical Context Applications

**Colossae Setting:** The ability to read this letter while standing on the actual archaeological site brings the personal relationships and geography to life, making the historical reality more tangible.

**Cultural Transformation:** Paul's request to receive Onesimus as a "brother" rather than a slave represents a radical shift in social relationships that would have shocked Roman sensibilities.

##### Contemporary Applications

**Conflict Resolution:** Paul's approach models addressing difficult situations with humor, confidence in the other person's character, and clear expectations while allowing for voluntary compliance.

**Social Justice:** The letter demonstrates how kingdom values transform oppressive social systems through changed relationships rather than merely political activism.

**Church Accountability:** The public nature of the letter shows how community involvement can provide healthy pressure for doing what's right.

#### Brief Personalized Summary

BEMA Episode 164 transforms what could be seen as a minor New Testament letter into a rich exploration of social transformation, conflict resolution, and the power of faith-based motivation. Marty's detailed exposition of Roman social structures, citizenship requirements, and the patronage system provides crucial context that makes Paul's letter come alive as a masterpiece of pastoral care and social activism.

The episode's most powerful insight centers on Paul's confidence in faith works over law works. Rather than commanding obedience through apostolic authority, Paul trusts that Philemon will do the right thing when reminded of his true identity and values. This approach reflects a profound understanding of human motivation and transformation - people change not primarily through external pressure but through internal conviction about what leads to flourishing.

Paul's use of humor throughout the letter demonstrates his relationship with Philemon and his confidence in the outcome. The tongue-in-cheek sarcasm, public pressure through copying the church, and emotional appeals show a pastor who knows his people and believes in their capacity for good. This stands in stark contrast to heavy-handed approaches that rely on shame, fear, or raw authority.

The historical context around Onesimus's potential background as a product of the sublatus system adds depth to understanding the radical transformation Paul requests. Moving from "useful slave" to "beloved brother" represents not just individual change but a fundamental challenge to Roman social hierarchies. The letter becomes a quiet revolution wrapped in personal correspondence.

Perhaps most relevant for contemporary readers is Paul's model of addressing injustice through transformed relationships rather than merely political activism. While not dismissing the need for systemic change, the letter shows how kingdom values work from the inside out, changing hearts and then systems. This provides a template for modern Christians navigating complex social issues with both grace and prophetic courage.

### BEMA Episode 136: Each One - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 136: Each One  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon & Brent Billings  
**Topic:** Analysis of Acts chapters 3-6, focusing on the post-Pentecost early church community and their manifestation of Kingdom living through practical service, healing, and shared resources. The discussion centers on how the early believers fulfilled messianic prophecies through collective action rather than waiting for individual messianic fulfillment.

#### Key Takeaways

• The early church demonstrated Kingdom living through practical actions: healing the sick, sharing possessions, caring for widows, and addressing community conflicts constructively

• Persecution consistently followed acts of Kingdom demonstration, creating a pattern of "doing good → facing opposition" throughout Acts 3-6

• Jewish messianic expectations focused more on the arrival of an age (olam haba) than a single person, emphasizing collective transformation over individual saviorism

• The connection between Peter's shadow healing (Acts 5) and Isaiah 32's "shadow of a great rock" reveals Luke's literary technique linking apostolic ministry to prophetic fulfillment

• True messianic witness occurs when believers collectively embody Kingdom values, making God's will manifest "on earth as it is in heaven"

• The Holy Spirit's empowerment available to early believers is the same power accessible to modern Christians - the difference lies in willingness to act

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Post-Pentecost Transformation

The disciples underwent a gradual process of Holy Spirit empowerment, not just a single climactic Pentecost moment. Jesus had already breathed on them (John 20:22), saying "Receive the Holy Spirit," indicating a progressive rather than instantaneous transformation. This challenges the common narrative of Pentecost as the sole pivotal moment.

##### Pattern of Kingdom Demonstration and Persecution

A clear pattern emerges in Acts 3-6: Kingdom demonstration → persecution → continued Kingdom work. Examples include:

- Healing the lame man → Sanhedrin confrontation → continued ministry
- Apostolic healings → Sadducee jealousy and imprisonment → expanded ministry
- Organized care for widows → Stephen's persecution → Gospel spread

##### Collective Messianic Fulfillment

Jewish messianic expectations centered on the "age to come" (olam haba) rather than awaiting a single individual. Isaiah 32:1-2 speaks of "a king" (singular) but "rulers" (plural) who each provide shelter, refuge, and restoration. This suggests messianic work involves both Jesus as king and believers as collaborative rulers bringing Kingdom reality.

##### Literary Connection: Shadow Imagery

Luke deliberately connects Peter's healing shadow (Acts 5:15) with Isaiah 32:2's "shadow of a great rock." Since Jesus named Peter "rock" (Petros), Luke presents Peter's shadow healings as fulfillment of messianic prophecy - the rock providing life-giving shade in spiritual desert places.

##### Community Economics and Care

The early church practiced radical economic sharing, selling property and distributing proceeds according to need. This wasn't mere charity but embodiment of Kingdom economics where "there were no needy persons among them" (Acts 4:34).

#### Examples & Applications

##### Biblical Examples from the Text

- **Healing Ministry:** Peter and John heal the lame beggar at the Beautiful Gate, demonstrating Kingdom power accessible through ordinary believers
- **Conflict Resolution:** When Hellenistic Jews complained about widow neglect, the apostles created a systematic solution by appointing seven deacons rather than engaging in divisive arguments
- **Economic Justice:** Barnabas (Joseph of Cyprus) exemplified generous giving by selling his field and donating proceeds to community needs

##### Contemporary Applications

- **Modern Church Witness:** The episode challenges contemporary Christians to demonstrate Kingdom reality through practical service rather than relying solely on theological arguments or apologetics
- **Jewish-Christian Relations:** Understanding Jewish messianic expectations helps explain why Jewish communities remain unconvinced by Christian claims - they seek evidence of Kingdom transformation, not just individual salvation
- **Community Response to Crisis:** The early church's method of addressing internal conflicts (Acts 6) provides a model for contemporary churches facing division

##### Historical Context

During the Second Temple period, messianic expectations were more prominent than in other eras of Jewish history, influenced by Roman occupation and writings like Daniel. However, these expectations never included the concept of God incarnate - such ideas remained blasphemous to Jewish thinking.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Literary Analysis

- Kenneth Bailey's work on Lucan literary techniques, particularly regarding the Beautiful Gate narrative structure
- Chiastic patterns in Acts healing narratives
- Symbolism of geographical locations (Solomon's Colonnade, temple gates) in Luke's theology

##### Historical-Cultural Studies

- Comparison between Hellenistic and Hebraic Jewish communities in first-century Jerusalem
- Levite land ownership in diaspora contexts (Barnabas owning land in Cyprus)
- Sanhedrin structures: formal vs. informal proceedings in early church persecution

##### Theological Implications

- Progressive sanctification vs. crisis experience models of spiritual growth
- Corporate vs. individual models of messianic fulfillment
- Kingdom ethics and contemporary economic justice movements

##### Contemporary Church Practice

- Modern applications of radical economic sharing in Christian communities
- Strategies for maintaining unity amid cultural diversity in churches
- Integration of healing ministry with practical social service

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Explain the pattern** that emerges throughout Acts 3-6 regarding Kingdom demonstration and persecution. Why might this pattern be significant for understanding early church ministry and contemporary Christian witness?

2. **Compare Jewish messianic expectations** with common Christian understanding of messianic prophecy. How does understanding the Jewish focus on "age to come" rather than individual messiah change your perspective on passages like Isaiah 32?

3. **Analyze the connection** between Peter's shadow healing in Acts 5 and Isaiah 32's "shadow of a great rock." What literary technique is Luke employing, and what theological point is he making about apostolic ministry?

4. **Evaluate the early church's response** to internal conflict in Acts 6 regarding widow care. What principles can contemporary churches extract from their conflict resolution method?

5. **Assess Marty's argument** that Jewish acceptance of Jesus depends more on Christian demonstration of Kingdom values than on apologetic arguments. Do you agree or disagree with this perspective, and what evidence supports your position?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This episode reveals how the early church embodied messianic prophecies through collective Kingdom demonstration rather than individual heroism. The pattern of good works followed by persecution shows that genuine Kingdom living disrupts status quo systems, whether religious or political. Luke's literary connection between Peter's healing shadow and Isaiah's "shadow of a great rock" demonstrates how ordinary believers can fulfill extraordinary prophetic roles. The episode challenges modern Christians to move beyond theological correctness toward practical Kingdom embodiment - healing the sick, sharing resources, and resolving conflicts constructively. Most provocatively, it suggests that Jewish skepticism toward Christian claims stems not from theological blindness but from the absence of visible Kingdom transformation in Christian communities throughout history. The same Holy Spirit power available to early apostles remains accessible today; the question becomes whether contemporary believers will embrace the costly calling to demonstrate God's will "on earth as it is in heaven."

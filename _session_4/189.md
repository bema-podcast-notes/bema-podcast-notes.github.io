### BEMA Episode 189: Revelation - The End Is a New Beginning - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 189 - Revelation: The End Is a New Beginning
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Revelation 21-22 - The Vision of New Heaven and New Earth

This episode concludes the book of Revelation and the entire journey through Scripture. The hosts explore John's apocalyptic vision of a new heaven and new earth, examining how this conclusion brings together themes from throughout the Bible, particularly from the prophets. The discussion emphasizes that Revelation's ending is not primarily about escaping earth for heaven, but about heaven and earth reuniting as God originally intended, fulfilling promises made throughout Scripture.

#### Key Takeaways

- The vision of new heaven and new earth represents the reunion of soil and spirit that was torn apart in Genesis 3, fulfilling the groaning of creation described in Romans 8
- John's apocalyptic imagery is not original but deliberately draws from earlier prophetic visions, particularly Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, and Daniel
- The new Jerusalem represents God's temple expanding to encompass the entire civilized world, not a literal architectural plan
- The number 12 appears repeatedly (12 tribes, 12 apostles, 12 gates, 12 foundations, 12,000 stadia) to emphasize that this is about God's unified people with enough room for everyone
- John's primary purpose was to encourage persecuted Christians under Domitian's rule to persevere, reminding them that God would get the last word
- The conclusion brings the biblical narrative full circle back to Eden imagery, suggesting restoration rather than abandonment of creation
- Many passages traditionally interpreted as judgmental pronouncements are actually references to Old Testament texts being woven into the apocalyptic vision

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Reunion of Heaven and Earth

The central theme of Revelation's conclusion is the reunification of heaven and earth, reversing the separation that occurred in Genesis 3. This is not about believers escaping earth to go to heaven, but about God's dwelling place coming down to be among people. The phrase "God's dwelling place is now among the people" (Revelation 21:3) represents the ultimate fulfillment of the incarnational mission begun in Jesus.

This reunion fulfills Paul's description in Romans 8 of creation groaning and waiting for restoration. Since the Fall, when soil and spirit were torn apart, the created order has been waiting for this moment of reconciliation.

##### Apocalyptic Literature as Prophetic Fulfillment

John's vision deliberately draws from earlier apocalyptic prophets, particularly:

- **Isaiah 65** - The vision of new heavens and new earth, God wiping away tears
- **Ezekiel 47** - The river flowing from the temple, trees bearing fruit for healing
- **Ezekiel's temple vision** - Measurement of the temple, but John expands it even larger
- **Zechariah** - Nations streaming to the city of God, gates never shut
- **Daniel 8, 9, and 12** - The language of visions and angelic messengers

This pattern demonstrates that John is not inventing new theology but showing how earlier prophetic promises find their culmination. Each reference serves to assure the original readers that God's ancient promises remain trustworthy.

##### The Expansive Temple

In Ezekiel's vision, the temple was large enough to encompass Jerusalem. John takes this imagery and expands it exponentially - the new city measures 12,000 stadia (approximately 1,400 miles) square, covering the entire known civilized world. The walls are 144 cubits (over 200 feet) thick.

This hyperbolic imagery communicates abundance and inclusion rather than literal architecture. The message is clear: there is enough of God's presence for everyone. The temple is no longer a building in a city or even a city itself, but encompasses all of creation.

##### The Absence of a Temple

Paradoxically, John states "I did not see a temple in the city" (Revelation 21:22). This is because the entire new creation has become the temple - the place where heaven and earth meet. God and the Lamb themselves are the temple, eliminating the need for a structure to mediate between the divine and human realms.

This fulfills the trajectory seen throughout Scripture of God's presence expanding from the Holy of Holies, to the temple, to the incarnation in Jesus, to the indwelling of believers, and finally to all creation.

##### Symbolism of Twelve

The number 12 saturates the vision:
- 12 gates with names of the 12 tribes of Israel
- 12 foundations with names of the 12 apostles
- 12,000 stadia dimensions
- 144 cubits wall thickness (12 x 12)
- 12 precious stones (corresponding to the stones on the high priest's breastplate)
- Tree of life bearing 12 crops of fruit

This consistent use of 12 emphasizes the unity of God's people across both Old and New Testament eras. The vision bridges Jewish and Christian identity, showing Jesus as the new Israel incorporating both 12 tribes and 12 apostles.

##### Eden Restored

John deliberately uses creation imagery to bring the narrative full circle:

- The tree of life, forbidden since Genesis 3, is now accessible
- A river flows from God's throne (echoing the river in Eden)
- Light exists without the sun (as in Genesis 1, before the sun was created on day 4)
- The curse is lifted
- Humanity sees God's face and has His name on their foreheads

This is not a new creation ex nihilo but a restoration and fulfillment of what was always intended. The end is revealed to be a new beginning.

##### Misunderstood Judgment Passages

Several passages traditionally interpreted as pronouncements of eternal damnation are actually references to Old Testament texts:

- Revelation 21:8 (the "lake of fire" verse) connects to 2 Samuel 7, where God speaks to David about building the temple - the very subject John is discussing
- Revelation 22:18-19 (warnings against adding or removing words) echoes Deuteronomy and Proverbs regarding the sacred text
- Lists of those excluded from the city draw from covenant language throughout the Hebrew Scriptures

Understanding these as textual allusions rather than standalone theological pronouncements changes how we read them.

##### The Message of Perseverance

For the original audience facing persecution under Domitian, John's vision served as encouragement to remain faithful. The repeated refrain "I am coming soon" addressed their immediate suffering, assuring them that God would vindicate His people and that Rome's power was temporary.

The vision calls believers to "overcome" and "persevere," maintaining their witness even in the face of death. The promise is not escape from suffering but the assurance that their faithfulness participates in God's ultimate victory.

##### Possible Chiastic Structure

Marty suggests that Revelation may be structured as a giant chiasm, with parallel elements at the beginning and end:

- Alpha and Omega references frame the book
- The morning star appears in the letter to Thyatira and at the conclusion
- The woman on the beast/dragon creates symmetry
- Many images from the opening chapters are recapitulated in the closing

While not fully developed, this structural observation reinforces John's careful literary craftsmanship and connection to Jewish interpretive methods.

#### Examples & Applications

##### The 1,400 Mile City

When John describes a city 12,000 stadia square (approximately 1,400 miles), he is using apocalyptic hyperbole to make a theological point. This would cover the distance from Jerusalem to beyond Rome, encompassing the entire Mediterranean world known to his audience. The point is not architectural blueprints but the message: God's presence will fill all creation, and there is room for all peoples.

##### The 12 Stones

The 12 precious stones adorning the city's foundations correspond to the 12 stones on the high priest's breastplate in Exodus. This connection means the entire new creation functions as the Holy of Holies, with all of God's people serving as priests. What was once mediated through a single high priest entering once a year is now the permanent reality for all.

##### No Need for Sun or Moon

The statement that the city needs no sun or moon deliberately echoes Genesis 1, where light existed before the creation of the sun on day 4. This brings the narrative full circle - the light that existed at creation (God's own glory) will be the light of the new creation. It is not about the physics of a future city but about God's unmediated presence.

##### The Gates Never Shut

In ancient cities, gates were shut at night for protection from enemies. John's vision of gates that never close (because there is no night) communicates perfect security and constant access. Drawing from Isaiah and Zechariah, this image shows nations streaming continuously into God's presence without fear or restriction.

##### Washing Robes

The image of those who "wash their robes" to have the right to the tree of life connects to earlier Revelation imagery of being cleansed by the Lamb's blood. This is covenant language about remaining faithful within the community, not a works-based salvation system.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Detailed Study of Old Testament Sources** - A systematic examination of each Old Testament passage John references would reveal how extensively Revelation is woven from earlier Scripture. Particularly profitable would be deep dives into Isaiah 40-66, Ezekiel 40-48, and Zechariah 12-14.

2. **Jewish Apocalyptic Literature** - Comparing Revelation with non-canonical apocalyptic works like 1 Enoch, 4 Ezra, and 2 Baruch would illuminate the genre conventions John was working within and what his original audience would have recognized.

3. **The Chiastic Structure** - Mapping out a full chiastic structure of Revelation, if one exists, would reveal additional layers of meaning and demonstrate John's literary sophistication.

4. **New Creation Theology** - Examining how the theme of renewed creation (rather than destruction of creation) appears throughout Scripture, from Isaiah's new heavens and earth to Paul's groaning creation to Peter's renewal by fire.

5. **The Historical Context of Domitian's Persecution** - Deeper research into the specific pressures facing Christians under Domitian would clarify how John's specific images would have been heard and what hope they offered.

6. **Temple Imagery Throughout Scripture** - Tracing the evolution of temple theology from tabernacle, to Solomon's temple, to Ezekiel's vision, to Jesus as temple, to believers as temple, to all creation as temple.

7. **The Exodus Wedding Motif** - Exploring how John uses marriage imagery connecting to the Exodus covenant and how this frames God's relationship with His people.

8. **Early Christian Expectation of Jesus' Return** - Investigating how the early church understood "coming soon" and how their theology developed when Jesus did not return within their generation.

9. **Revelation's Influence on Christian Eschatology** - Studying how this book has been interpreted throughout church history and how those interpretations have shaped Christian belief and practice.

10. **The Ethics of Apocalyptic Hope** - Examining how belief in God's ultimate victory should shape present behavior, particularly regarding non-violence, compassion, and resistance to empire.

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does John's vision of new heaven and new earth address the separation of soil and spirit that occurred in Genesis 3, and what does this reveal about God's redemptive plan for creation rather than escape from it?

2. Why does John draw so heavily from earlier apocalyptic prophets like Ezekiel, Isaiah, and Zechariah, and what message does this send to his persecuted audience about the trustworthiness of God's promises?

3. What is the significance of the number 12 appearing repeatedly throughout the vision (tribes, apostles, gates, foundations, dimensions), and how does this communicate the unity and inclusiveness of God's people?

4. How does understanding Revelation 21:8 as a reference to 2 Samuel 7 (in the context of David building the temple) change the interpretation of this passage compared to reading it as a standalone judgment pronouncement?

5. What does it mean that John sees no temple in the new Jerusalem even though he is using extensive temple imagery, and how does this represent the culmination of God's presence expanding throughout Scripture?

#### Summary

BEMA Episode 189 brings the study of Scripture to a powerful conclusion by examining Revelation's vision of new heaven and new earth reuniting. Rather than portraying an escape from creation, John shows God's dwelling place coming down to be among people, fulfilling the ancient promise that began with Eden, was enacted in the tabernacle and temple, took flesh in Jesus, and now encompasses all creation.

The episode emphasizes that John is not inventing new theology but weaving together threads from earlier prophetic visions. Every major image - the river of life, the tree of life, the measured temple, nations streaming to the city, God wiping away tears - comes from earlier Scripture, particularly Isaiah, Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Daniel. This deliberate intertextuality assures persecuted Christians that the ancient promises remain trustworthy and that God will get the last word.

The consistent use of the number 12 communicates that God's people are unified across all eras, with the 12 tribes of Israel and 12 apostles of the Lamb together forming the foundation of the new creation. The hyperbolic dimensions (1,400 miles square, 200-foot walls) communicate abundance and inclusion - there is enough of God's presence for everyone.

John brings the biblical narrative full circle by using Eden imagery: the tree of life is accessible again, the river flows, light exists without the sun, the curse is lifted, and humanity sees God's face. This is not creation 2.0 but creation 1.0 fulfilled. The end is revealed as a new beginning, the restoration of what was always intended.

For modern readers, the episode challenges common interpretations that focus on judgment and escape while missing the message of hope, restoration, and God's commitment to redeem all creation. Understanding Revelation as apocalyptic literature addressing specific historical circumstances helps us receive its message of encouragement: remain faithful, because God's good purposes will prevail, and heaven and earth will be reunited as they were always meant to be.

### BEMA Episode 150: Romans - Righteousness from God

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode continues the BEMA podcast's exploration of Paul's letter to the Romans, specifically focusing on Romans 3:21-5:6. The discussion centers on understanding righteousness as a gift from God rather than something earned through human effort or law-keeping. Marty Solomon and Brent Billings examine how Paul addresses the blended family dynamics in the Roman church and establishes that both Jews and Gentiles receive justification through faith, using Abraham as the prime example of righteousness apart from works.

#### Key Takeaways

- All people fall short of any measuring stick (whether self-imposed, moral, or God's Torah) and have a conscience that testifies against them
- Righteousness comes from God as a gift, not from human performance or law-keeping
- Romans 3:23 is commonly quoted out of context - it states both that "all have sinned" AND "all are justified freely by his grace"
- Abraham received righteousness through faith before circumcision, making him the father of faith for both Jews and Gentiles
- Justification means to be "declared righteous" or "exonerated" - it's a legal declaration, not earned wages
- The gospel (euangelion) Paul preaches challenges the Roman empire's own "gospel" of Caesar's rule
- Faith and trust are synonymous terms referring to believing in God's story and promises
- Reading Romans requires looking forward through biblical narrative context, not backward through Reformation theology

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Universal Human Condition

Paul establishes that all humans share the same fundamental problem: regardless of what measuring stick we use (personal morality, societal standards, or divine law), we all fall short and experience the testimony of a guilty conscience. This creates universal fear and insecurity that cannot be resolved through human effort or rule-following.

##### Righteousness from God vs. Human Effort

The central theological concept is the distinction between righteousness earned through works (wages) versus righteousness received as a gift from God. Paul uses economic metaphors of wages and gifts to illustrate that justification cannot be earned like a paycheck but must be received through trust in God's promises.

##### Abraham as the Prototype of Faith

Abraham serves as the archetypal example of righteousness through faith because he trusted God's promises before receiving circumcision and before the law was given. His righteousness was "credited" or "reckoned" to his account not because of his perfect behavior (which he didn't have) but because of his trust in God's character and promises.

##### The Blended Family Dynamic in Rome

The historical context involves Jewish Christians who were expelled from Rome under Emperor Claudius returning to find Gentile Christians had established the church in their absence. Paul addresses the resulting tension by showing that neither group has grounds for boasting since both receive the same justification through the same faith.

##### Justification and the Judge (Shofet)

Drawing from Hebrew understanding, a judge (shofet) not only pronounces judgment but also carries it out. God serves as both the one who declares justice and the one who brings about the restoration that justice requires. This results in God being both "just and the justifier."

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Misreading of Scripture

The common practice of quoting Romans 3:23 ("all have sinned and fall short") while ignoring the continuation ("and all are justified freely by his grace") demonstrates how theological assumptions can distort biblical meaning. Paul's point is not condemnation but universal access to grace.

##### The Wage vs. Gift Analogy

Just as a worker expects payment for services rendered, people often expect righteousness as payment for religious performance. However, Paul argues that righteousness functions more like an inheritance or gift - something received based on relationship rather than performance.

##### Abraham's Pre-Circumcision Faith

Abraham's experience in Genesis 15 (trusting God's promise about descendants) occurred before his circumcision in Genesis 17. This chronology proves that righteousness preceded the covenant sign, making Abraham's faith accessible to both circumcised Jews and uncircumcised Gentiles.

##### Reading Scripture in Context

Rather than interpreting Romans through later theological developments (Augustine, Luther, Calvin), the episode advocates reading it through the lens of the broader biblical narrative established in earlier BEMA sessions, particularly the foundation of "trusting the story" from Genesis 1.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Historical Context of Roman Imperial Gospel

The concept of euangelion (gospel) in the Roman context as announcements of imperial victory and how Paul's alternative gospel challenges Roman authority structures.

##### Hebrew Concepts of Justice (Mishpat)

Deeper study of Old Testament concepts of justice that inform Paul's understanding of God as both just and justifier, including the restorative rather than merely punitive nature of divine justice.

##### The Relationship Between Faith and Works

Exploration of how Paul's argument against works-righteousness relates to his continued affirmation of the law's importance and the role of obedience in the Christian life.

##### Abraham in Jewish Thought

Investigation of how first-century Jewish understanding of Abraham as the father of faith would have shaped Paul's argument for his mixed Jewish-Gentile audience.

##### The Holy Spirit's Role in Assurance

Study of how the Spirit's work in pouring God's love into believers' hearts creates experiential knowledge of acceptance beyond intellectual understanding.

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does Paul's argument in Romans 3:21-23 challenge both the practice of quoting verse 23 in isolation and the assumption that some groups have spiritual advantages over others?

2. Why is Abraham's pre-circumcision faith crucial to Paul's argument about universal access to righteousness, and how does this address the tensions in the Roman church?

3. What is the significance of Paul's wage vs. gift metaphor in Romans 4, and how does this economic imagery continue through to Romans 6:23?

4. How does understanding the Hebrew concept of shofet (judge) as one who both declares and enacts justice change our understanding of God's role in justification?

5. According to the episode, what is the difference between reading Romans through the lens of later Christian theology versus reading it through the forward progression of biblical narrative?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This episode fundamentally reframes how we understand righteousness and justification in Romans. Rather than seeing these chapters as primarily about individual salvation from sin, Paul is addressing community dynamics and universal human insecurity. The revolutionary insight is that both the problem (falling short of any standard) and the solution (righteousness from God through faith) are universal. Abraham serves as the paradigmatic example because his trust in God's promises predates all religious markers, making faith accessible to everyone. This understanding challenges both ancient prejudices between Jewish and Gentile believers and modern tendencies to turn faith into a new kind of performance-based system. The ultimate message is that God's love and acceptance are foundational truths to be trusted rather than rewards to be earned, providing the security and peace that human effort can never achieve.

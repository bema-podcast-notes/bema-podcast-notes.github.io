### BEMA 234: Jen Rosner - The Jewish Roots of Christianity - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 234 - Jen Rosner - The Jewish Roots of Christianity
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Guest:** Dr. Jennifer Rosner, Affiliate Assistant Professor of Systematic Theology at Fuller Theological Seminary
**Focus:** Jewish-Christian relations, Messianic Judaism, supersessionism, and the ongoing covenant with Israel

This episode features Dr. Jennifer Rosner, a Jewish follower of Jesus who teaches systematic theology at multiple institutions including Fuller Seminary, King's University, and the Messianic Jewish Theological Institute. The conversation explores her personal journey from Judaism to faith in Jesus, her academic work bridging Judaism and Christianity, and the contemporary movement challenging traditional boundaries between these two faith traditions. Dr. Rosner discusses key theological issues including supersessionism, the Jewish roots of Christianity, and the significance of God's ongoing covenant with Israel for Christian theology.

#### Key Takeaways

- The relationship between Judaism and Christianity has historically been defined by mutual exclusion, but a new era of Jewish-Christian encounter is challenging these boundaries
- Supersessionism (replacement theology) is often an unconscious assumption in Christian theology that problematizes God's faithfulness to His covenant with Israel
- Messianic Judaism represents an important bridge between Judaism and Christianity, demonstrating that Jewish identity and following Jesus are not mutually exclusive
- Understanding the Jewish roots of Christianity requires Christians to rethink fundamental aspects of their theology, biblical interpretation, and practice
- The "new Jewish-Christian encounter" is characterized by Jews and Christians reconceiving their own traditions in light of substantive engagement with the other
- Karl Barth and Franz Rosenzweig represent key 20th-century figures who prefigured contemporary Jewish-Christian dialogue
- Bruce Marshall's question frames the core tension: How can we affirm both the ongoing significance of God's covenant with Israel and the universal saving mission of Christ?
- Two main perspectives exist within Messianic Judaism: one emphasizing charismatic Spirit-led freedom, the other emphasizing thoughtful connection to rabbinic Judaism and Jewish tradition
- Affirming God's covenant with Israel necessarily involves affirming the Jewish people's call to Torah observance and Jewish practice

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Supersessionism (Replacement Theology)

Supersessionism, derived from the verb "supersede," is the theological position that God's covenant through Jesus Christ in the New Testament supersedes or replaces God's covenant with the people of Israel in the Old Testament. This theology positions Israel as "old, outdated, done away with" and focuses exclusively on the church as God's new covenant people.

Key problems with supersessionism:

- It raises questions about God's faithfulness - if God abandoned His covenant with Israel, can we trust His covenant commitments?
- It can manifest as either punitive (Israel failed, so God moved on) or developmental (Israel was just the starting point), but both frameworks are problematic
- It is often unconscious and embedded in Christian worldview, rarely examined or questioned
- It allows Christians to ignore Judaism and the Jewish people entirely without consequences for their faith
- It misses lines of continuity between the covenants and God's ongoing purposes for Israel

The most comprehensive treatment of this topic is Kendall Soulen's "The God of Israel and Christian Theology." Post-supersessionist theology is a major contemporary movement in Christian scholarship.

##### The New Jewish-Christian Encounter

Dr. Rosner identifies four distinctive markers of what she calls the "new Jewish-Christian encounter":

1. **Commitment to robust theology** - Not just cultural appreciation but deep theological engagement
2. **Assessment of the other tradition in light of your own** - Christians examining Judaism from a Christian theological perspective
3. **Recognition of commonalities** - Identifying shared foundations and connections
4. **Reassessment of your own tradition** - The unique feature where Jews and Christians begin to reconceive their own identity and theology after substantive encounter with the other

This is not merely interfaith dialogue or world religions study. The new Jewish-Christian encounter recognizes that Judaism is, in John Howard Yoder's words, "a non non-Christian religion" - it cannot be placed in the same category as other non-Christian religions due to its inherent connection to Christianity.

##### Bruce Marshall's Central Question

Catholic theologian Bruce Marshall poses the fundamental question that frames contemporary Jewish-Christian theological dialogue:

"How can we affirm both the ongoing significance and endurance of God's covenant with the people of Israel and the universal, ecclesially mediated saving mission of Christ?"

This question captures the core tension: the majority of Jewish people, from Jesus' day until now, have rejected Jesus as Messiah. How can Christians affirm they are still God's chosen covenant people while also maintaining the necessity of following Jesus?

Importantly, Marshall recognizes that affirming God's covenant with Israel also requires affirming:
- The Jewish people's call to be Torah observant
- Judaism as a religion and set of practices
- Rabbinic tradition as a legitimate development of covenant faithfulness

It's not an abstract affirmation of Jewish chosenness, but a concrete acknowledgment of Jewish religious practice as part of covenant identity.

##### Two Perspectives Within Messianic Judaism

Dr. Rosner's book "At the Foot of the Mountain" (co-written with Joshua Lessard) explores two dominant perspectives within the Messianic Jewish movement:

**Charismatic/Spirit-Centered Perspective (represented by Joshua Lessard):**
- Emphasizes freedom for the Holy Spirit to move without predetermined structures
- Aligns with charismatic Christianity with Jewish cultural elements
- Concerns that rigid commitment to Jewish tradition might hinder the Spirit's work
- Example: Should someone at McDonald's focus on whether to order a kosher cheeseburger or whether God is calling them to share the Gospel with someone nearby?

**Tradition-Engaged Perspective (represented by Dr. Rosner):**
- Emphasizes thoughtful connection to rabbinic Judaism and Jewish tradition
- Challenges wholesale dismissal of rabbinic tradition just because rabbis rejected Jesus
- Suggests God may still be guiding rabbinic development as part of His covenant faithfulness
- Argues that if we call ourselves "Messianic Judaism," we need substantive engagement with Judaism, not just reaction against Orthodox Judaism

Dr. Rosner advocates for a both/and approach rather than either/or - it's possible to honor both Spirit-led spontaneity and covenantal commitment to Jewish practice.

##### Karl Barth's Influence

Karl Barth (1886-1968) was a Swiss Protestant theologian described as a "theological Everest" - one of the most influential Christian thinkers of the 20th century. His impact includes:

- Living through both World Wars and engaging theology with contemporary events
- Famous maxim: "Do theology with the Bible in one hand and the newspaper in the other" (text to context)
- His magnum opus, "Church Dogmatics," spans 14 volumes of several hundred pages each
- Very Christocentric theology - everything comes back to Christ
- One of the first major Protestant theologians to think deeply about God's ongoing covenant with Israel
- Though limited by his historical context, he initiated crucial conversations about Israel's ongoing purpose in God's plan

Barth scholarship continues to expand because he was thoughtful about virtually every aspect of Christian theology.

##### Franz Rosenzweig's Jewish Perspective

Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929) was a Jewish philosopher and theologian who represents the Jewish side of the Jewish-Christian dialogue that Dr. Rosner examines. Together with Barth, he prefigures the contemporary "new Jewish-Christian encounter" by:

- Engaging seriously with Christian theology from a Jewish perspective
- Demonstrating how Jewish thinkers can assess Christianity while remaining committed to Judaism
- Contributing to the theological foundations for mutual understanding and respect

##### "Unparting the Ways"

Dr. Rosner's vision for the future includes thoroughly rethinking "the parting of the ways" between Judaism and Christianity. Rather than accepting as inevitable that these are two separate, mutually exclusive religions, she advocates for:

- Challenging the boundaries and definitions that separate Judaism and Christianity
- Raising the profile of Messianic Judaism as a bridge tradition
- Recognizing Messianic Judaism's significance for questions of covenant fidelity
- Demonstrating that Jewish followers of Jesus can maintain meaningful connection to Judaism not just as personal preference but as covenant faithfulness

The proposed title "Unparting the Ways" captures this vision of reconnection and boundary-challenging.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Dr. Rosner's Personal Journey

Dr. Rosner's story illustrates the journey many Jewish followers of Jesus experience:

- Raised in a Jewish home with strong Jewish identity but no local synagogue connection
- Heard the Gospel for the first time in college at a large public university in California
- Spent her final undergraduate year exploring who Jesus was and whether He mattered to her
- Came to faith in Jesus, which reoriented her entire life and professional trajectory
- Initially "shelved" her Jewish identity because she had no models for being both Jewish and following Jesus
- During her Master of Divinity program, her Jewish identity "started clamoring for attention again"
- Has spent her personal and professional life since then figuring out what it means to be both Jewish and a follower of Jesus

This journey reflects the broader historical reality: the mutual exclusivity between Judaism and Christianity has been so entrenched that many Jewish believers in Jesus have felt forced to choose one identity or the other.

##### Gerald McDermott's Transformation

Dr. McDermott's story demonstrates how encounter with Jewish perspectives can transform Christian theology:

- Came from Reformed Christian circles, deeply immersed in supersessionist replacement theology
- While leading a trip to Israel, gave supersessionist lectures at various sites
- A friend would pull him aside during lunch: "Jerry, did you ever think about..."
- Experienced a complete revolution in his thinking
- Became one of the key Christian voices calling out problems with supersessionist theology
- Organized the conference that became the book "Understanding the Jewish Roots of Christianity"

This illustrates how even deeply embedded theological frameworks can be transformed through substantive encounter with Jewish perspectives.

##### The McDonald's Example

Joshua Lessard's example from "At the Foot of the Mountain" captures the tension between two perspectives in Messianic Judaism:

Should someone at McDonald's be thinking about:
- Whether to order a cheeseburger (which violates kashrut/kosher dietary laws)?
- Whether God is calling them to sit next to someone and share the Gospel?

This example reveals the core question: Are we primarily oriented toward covenantal obedience to Torah and tradition, or toward spontaneous responsiveness to the Spirit's leading in the moment? Dr. Rosner's response suggests both can be honored simultaneously.

##### Marty's Transformation

Marty Solomon's experience on the podcast illustrates the skepticism many have toward Messianic Judaism and how that can be overcome:

- Had limited experiences with Messianic Judaism before meeting Dr. Rosner
- Started with significant skepticism and low expectations
- Dr. Rosner not only exceeded expectations but introduced him to academic circles and voices he was unaware of
- Through her work and connections, discovered a whole world of rigorous Messianic Jewish scholarship
- Experienced transformation in his understanding of what Messianic Judaism could be

This demonstrates that quality scholarship and authentic engagement can overcome stereotypes and expand understanding.

##### Yachad BeYeshua

This organization represents practical application of Dr. Rosner's vision:

- Connects Jewish followers of Jesus from across the spectrum
- Includes Roman Catholic Jews, Eastern Orthodox Jews, Messianic Jews, and others
- Brings together people with different day-to-day lives, locations, and careers
- Creates space for diverse Jewish Jesus-followers to think together, work together, and learn from each other
- Demonstrates that Jewish identity in Christ transcends denominational boundaries

This shows how the "new Jewish-Christian encounter" can create new forms of community and connection.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Biblical Hermeneutics and the Unity of Scripture

How should Christians read the Bible as one coherent whole when understanding God's ongoing covenant with Israel? What interpretive frameworks allow for continuity between Old and New Testament without falling into supersessionism?

##### The Development of Rabbinic Judaism

If God's covenant with Israel continues, what is the theological status of rabbinic tradition and development? Can Christians affirm that God has been guiding rabbinic Judaism even while maintaining the truth claims of Christianity?

##### Paul's Theology in Jewish Context

How does understanding Paul as a Jewish thinker writing to primarily Gentile audiences transform our reading of his letters? What is the relationship between the "New Perspective on Paul" and post-supersessionist theology?

##### Jewish Practice and Covenant Fidelity

For Jewish followers of Jesus, is Torah observance and Jewish practice a matter of personal preference, cultural heritage, or covenantal obligation? What theological frameworks support different answers to this question?

##### The Church's Historical Treatment of Jews

What is the relationship between supersessionist theology and the historical persecution of Jewish people by Christians? How does anti-Semitism relate to Christian theology, and how can Christians address this legacy?

##### Gentile Christians and Jewish Practice

What is the appropriate relationship between Gentile Christians and Jewish practice? How can Christians honor and learn from Jewish roots without appropriating Jewish identity?

##### Liturgy and Worship

What are the Jewish foundations of Christian liturgical practice? How might recovering these roots enrich Christian worship?

##### Ritual Purity in the Gospels

Matt Thiessen's work on ritual purity in the Gospels represents an important area for understanding Jesus in His Jewish context. How does understanding purity laws reshape our reading of Gospel narratives?

##### Eschatology and Israel

What role does Israel play in Christian eschatology? How do different views of the end times affect Christian-Jewish relations?

##### The Saturday/Sunday Question

What theological and historical factors led to the shift from Sabbath (Saturday) to Sunday worship? What implications does this shift have for understanding the relationship between Judaism and Christianity?

##### Sin and the Fall in Comparative Perspective

How do Jewish and Christian understandings of sin and the fall differ? What can Christians learn from Jewish anthropology and soteriology?

##### The Ongoing Prophetic Tradition

If God's covenant with Israel continues, does that have implications for ongoing prophecy and revelation within Judaism? How do Christians navigate claims to continuing revelation in both traditions?

#### Comprehension Questions

1. What is supersessionism (replacement theology), and why does Dr. Rosner argue it is problematic for understanding God's faithfulness? How might this theology affect the way Christians read Scripture and relate to Jewish people?

2. Describe Bruce Marshall's central question that frames contemporary Jewish-Christian theological dialogue. Why is his recognition of the connection between God's covenant with Israel and Torah observance significant?

3. What are the four distinctive markers of what Dr. Rosner calls the "new Jewish-Christian encounter"? How is the fourth marker (reassessment of your own tradition) unique and significant?

4. Explain the two main perspectives within Messianic Judaism as represented in Dr. Rosner's book "At the Foot of the Mountain." How does the McDonald's example illustrate this tension, and what is Dr. Rosner's proposed resolution?

5. What is Dr. Rosner's vision for "unparting the ways" between Judaism and Christianity? How does Messianic Judaism function as a bridge tradition in this vision, and why does she emphasize it as more than personal preference but rather covenant fidelity?

#### Brief Summary

This episode introduces Dr. Jennifer Rosner, a Jewish follower of Jesus who teaches systematic theology and specializes in Jewish-Christian relations. Her personal journey from Judaism to faith in Jesus, and her subsequent rediscovery of her Jewish identity, mirrors broader historical and theological tensions between these two traditions.

The conversation centers on supersessionism - the unconscious assumption in much Christian theology that the church has replaced Israel as God's covenant people. Dr. Rosner argues this is problematic not just for Jewish people, but for understanding God's faithfulness and reading Scripture coherently. She introduces Bruce Marshall's central question: How can we affirm both God's ongoing covenant with Israel (including Torah observance) and the universal saving mission of Christ?

The episode explores the "new Jewish-Christian encounter" - a contemporary movement where Jews and Christians are reconceiving their own traditions after substantive theological engagement with each other. This goes beyond interfaith dialogue to actual transformation of self-understanding. Within Messianic Judaism, two perspectives exist: one emphasizing charismatic Spirit-led freedom, the other emphasizing thoughtful engagement with rabbinic tradition. Dr. Rosner advocates for both/and rather than either/or.

Key figures discussed include Karl Barth, whose 20th-century Protestant theology initiated important conversations about Israel's ongoing purpose, and Franz Rosenzweig, representing the Jewish philosophical perspective. The episode references several important books, including "Understanding the Jewish Roots of Christianity" (a collection of essays) and Dr. Rosner's "Healing the Schism," which uses Marshall's question to assess key thinkers.

Dr. Rosner's vision is to challenge the assumed "parting of the ways" between Judaism and Christianity, raising the profile of Messianic Judaism as demonstrating that Jewish identity and following Jesus are not mutually exclusive. Her work invites Christians to take seriously the Jewish roots of their faith and God's ongoing covenant with Israel, while inviting Jewish followers of Jesus to maintain meaningful connection to Judaism as an act of covenant fidelity.

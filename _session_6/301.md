### BEMA Episode 301: Study Notes - "On Doubting and Locked Doors"

#### Episode Overview

- **Hosts**: Brent Billings and Reed Dent
- **Primary Scripture**: John 20:19-31 (Thomas and the disciples)
- **Central Theme**: The nature of doubt and belief in discipleship
- **Key Figure**: Thomas (also called Didymus/The Twin)

---

#### Major Themes Explored

##### 1. The Character of Thomas - "Unvarnished Honesty"

###### Thomas's Previous Statements

- **John 11:16**: "Let us also go that we may die with him" (regarding Lazarus)
- **John 14:5**: "Lord, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the way?"
- **John 20:25**: "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands... I will not believe"

###### Character Analysis

- **Unvarnished speaker**: Says what comes to his mind without filter
- **Skeptical tendency**: Questions what others accept
- **Honest about limitations**: Admits when he doesn't understand
- **Possibly speaks for others**: Voices what everyone else is thinking but won't say

---

##### 2. Two Types of Doubt and Belief

###### Cognitive vs. Lived Experience

**COGNITIVE DOUBT** (Head Doubt):

- Intellectual skepticism or questioning
- Can be a useful analytical tool
- May not affect how one actually lives
- Example: Thomas asking for physical proof

**LIVED DOUBT** (Gut/Stomach Doubt):

- Deep existential uncertainty
- Born from experience/trauma
- Affects core behavior and trust
- Example: The disciples hiding behind locked doors despite "believing"

**COGNITIVE BELIEF**:

- Intellectual assent to propositions
- "Golden ticket" faith - say the right things
- May not change behavior
- Example: Disciples being "glad" but still hiding

**LIVED BELIEF**:

- Faith that transforms behavior and living
- Deeper than intellectual understanding
- Results in action and change
- Goal: Moving from cognitive to lived belief

---

##### 3. The Disciples' Response vs. Thomas's Response

###### The Other Disciples

- **Week 1**: Hiding behind locked doors "for fear of Jewish leaders"
- See Jesus, shown His hands and side, become "overjoyed"
- Receive Holy Spirit, given commission
- **Week 2**: Still hiding behind locked doors!
- **Paradox**: Cognitive belief with lived doubt

###### Thomas

- **Week 1**: Notably absent from the locked room (not hiding?)
- Responds to others' testimony with skepticism
- **Week 2**: Present when Jesus appears again
- **Transformation**: From cognitive doubt to lived belief
- **Response**: "My Lord and my God" - complete confession

---

##### 4. Jesus's Response to Doubt

###### Jesus's Approach to Thomas

- **No condemnation**: Doesn't scold or shame
- **Meets him where he is**: Provides exactly what Thomas requested
- **Gentle invitation**: "Put your finger here, see my hands"
- **After provision, then challenge**: "Stop doubting and believe"

###### Pattern Similar to Woman Caught in Adultery

1. **Grace first**: Meets need/provides what's requested
2. **No condemnation**: Doesn't shame or reject
3. **Then direction**: Challenges to move forward in faith

---

##### 5. The Nature of Seeing and Believing

###### Different Levels of Seeing

- **Seeing facts**: What Thomas had been doing
- **Seeing truth**: What happened when he encountered the risen Christ
- **Buechner's insight**: Thomas moved from seeing facts about Jesus to seeing the truth of who Jesus is

###### Jesus's Statement

- "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed" (John 20:29)
- Not condemnation of Thomas, but recognition of different paths to faith

---

#### Key Questions for Reflection

1. **Personal Doubt Assessment**:
   - Do I have cognitive doubt with lived belief?
   - Do I have cognitive belief with lived doubt?
   - What am I actually "hiding behind locked doors" about?

2. **Understanding Others**:
   - How do I respond to people expressing doubt?
   - Can I distinguish between different types of doubt in others?
   - Do I create space for honest questions?

3. **Faith Development**:
   - What would it look like to move from cognitive to lived belief?
   - Where do I need Jesus to "meet me where I am" like He did with Thomas?
   - What am I asking to "see" before I'll believe?

#### Cultural and Historical Context

##### First Century Setting

- **Jewish leaders**: Religious authorities post-crucifixion
- **Locked doors**: Real physical danger for Jesus's followers
- **Thomas as "Didymus"**: Greek for "twin" - significance unclear

##### John's Purpose (20:30-31)

- Writing to encourage persecuted Christians
- "These are written that you may believe/continue believing"
- Thomas represents the church's struggle with doubt amid persecution

---

#### Theological Insights

##### 1. **Doubt is Not the Enemy of Faith**

- Honest questioning can lead to deeper faith
- Doubt can be a tool for analysis and understanding
- The goal is not absence of questions but lived belief despite questions

##### 2. **God's Grace Meets Us in Our Doubt**

- Jesus provides evidence when asked (hands, side, wounds)
- Grace precedes behavioral change
- Meeting people where they are vs. demanding blind faith

##### 3. **Faith as Relationship vs. Position**

- Buechner: "Believing in God" vs. "Believing God"
- Position: intellectual assent (like believing world is round)
- Relationship: transformative encounter (like believing house is on fire)

##### 4. **The Role of Community in Faith**

- Thomas needed the other disciples' testimony
- Isolated faith vs. communal faith development
- Speaking doubts aloud in safe community

#### Notable Quotes and Insights

##### From the Episode

- "Thomas is just saying what they're not saying"
- "We can have cognitive doubt and still have lived belief"
- "The disciples can be in a place of... 'yeah, we accept, we see, we're glad' and yet we're not going out and doing"

##### From Buechner

- "Believing in God is an intellectual position... Believing God is something else again"
- "It affects who you are and what you do with your life like believing your house is on fire"

##### From the Poem by Denise Levertov

- "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief" (borrowed from Mark 9:24)
- "What I felt was not scalding pain... but light"
- "My question not answered, but given its part in a vast unfolding design"

#### Discussion Questions

3. How do you distinguish between helpful doubt and harmful doubt in your own life?
4. What "locked doors" do you find yourself behind despite your beliefs?
5. How can faith communities better support people experiencing doubt?

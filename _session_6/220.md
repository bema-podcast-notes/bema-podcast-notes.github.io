### BEMA Episode 220: The Chosen S1E1 - "I Have Called You by Name"

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 220 - The Chosen S1E1: "I Have Called You by Name"
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Review and theological discussion of The Chosen Season 1, Episode 1

This episode marks the beginning of BEMA's commentary series on The Chosen, a crowdfunded television series depicting the life of Jesus Christ. The hosts discuss the unique production approach of the series and provide detailed analysis of the first episode, which focuses on character development and backstories for Mary Magdalene, Nicodemus, Simon Peter, and Matthew. The episode explores themes of demon possession, religious authority, desperation, and Jesus's compassionate ministry to the marginalized.

---

#### Key Takeaways

- **The Chosen uses a "Christian midrash" approach** - Taking biblical elements and creating plausible backstories that illuminate the text without claiming to be Scripture itself.

- **The series excels in historical accuracy** - From clothing and architecture to socioeconomic realities of first-century Galilee, the show demonstrates careful research and attention to detail.

- **Demon possession is portrayed with appropriate complexity** - The show blurs the lines between spiritual oppression, mental illness, trauma, and PTSD in ways that reflect both ancient understanding and modern sensibilities.

- **Jesus enters quietly and compassionately** - Unlike typical Hollywood portrayals of divine power, Jesus's first appearance is marked by gentleness, knowing Mary's name, and speaking words that restore her identity.

- **The Pharisaical worldview is accurately depicted** - Nicodemus represents a sincere religious leader wrestling with the limitations of his tradition while remaining open to deeper truth.

- **Economic desperation drives behavior** - The show effectively demonstrates how poverty and debt could lead faithful Jews into morally compromising situations like fishing on Shabbat.

- **When did Shabbat become theater?** - Nicodemus's question challenges both ancient and modern religious performance that prioritizes appearance over authentic encounter with God.

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Crowdfunding Model and Production Approach

The Chosen represents a unique production model in Christian media. Rather than traditional Hollywood financing, the series is crowdfunded with a "pay it forward" donation system. Viewers can watch for free and are encouraged to support future seasons through voluntary contributions. This model allows for creative independence while building community investment in the project.

The series begins with a disclaimer explaining that while based on the gospels, it includes:
- Combined or condensed locations and timelines
- Added backstories and dialogue
- Artistic imagination designed to support the truth and intention of Scripture

Marty notes this approach succeeds where other biblical productions fail because it embraces being "a fictional dramatic presentation" rather than trying to stay rigidly within biblical dialogue, which often creates stilted, unnatural conversation.

##### The Midrashic Approach to Scripture

A messianic rabbi consultant described the series as "Christian midrash on the gospels." Midrash is the Jewish tradition of exploring what might lie between the lines of Scripture - not replacing the text but illuminating it through plausible narrative expansion.

This approach allows The Chosen to:
- Develop three-dimensional characters from brief biblical mentions
- Explore the socioeconomic and political realities of first-century Galilee
- Create emotional connections that help viewers understand why people responded to Jesus as they did
- Maintain respect for Scripture while acknowledging the creative imagination involved

##### Historical Context: The World of Second Temple Judaism

The episode effectively portrays several aspects of Second Temple Jewish life:

**Religious Diversity**: Quintus the Roman mentions Sadducees, Essenes, and Zealots - demonstrating the variety of Jewish responses to Roman occupation and religious questions.

**Socioeconomic Stratification**: The contrast between Matthew's wealthy quarter (with luxury items like door locks and multiple sandals) and the Red Quarter (where poverty makes Torah observance nearly impossible) illustrates how economic systems perpetuate inequality.

**Torah Observance and Purity Laws**: Nicodemus's concern about fish caught on Shabbat and his statement "what goes into a man defiles him" (the opposite of Jesus's later teaching) accurately represents Pharisaical focus on external purity.

**Tax Collection System**: Matthew's portrayal as a despised collaborator who enriches himself by collecting Roman taxes from his own people reflects historical reality. The public hatred, spitting, and ostracism he experiences would have been typical.

##### The Demonic Realm: Blurring Ancient and Modern Understanding

The episode's treatment of Mary's demon possession demonstrates theological sophistication. Rather than a simplistic "movie demon" portrayal, the show layers multiple interpretations:

**Ancient Understanding**: Second Temple Judaism had extensive demonology (reflected in apocryphal works like Enoch). They would have attributed many conditions we now understand as mental illness to demonic influence.

**Modern Categories**: Mary's symptoms could represent PTSD from sexual assault, grief from her father's death, mental illness like schizophrenia, or some combination.

**Theological Reality**: The show suggests something genuinely oppressive and beyond human help while avoiding the trap of making mental illness seem merely spiritual.

Marty notes that Nicodemus calling on angels (Gabriel, Raphael, Michael), patriarchs, and even the name of God - yet having "no power here" - sets up a crucial theological point: true demonic exorcism was understood as something only God could accomplish. This makes Jesus's later deliverance of Mary all the more significant.

##### Nicodemus: The Struggling Religious Scholar

Nicodemus emerges as the episode's most complex character - a "teacher of teachers" who is genuinely devout yet increasingly aware of the limitations of his religious system.

**Key Character Elements**:
- Member of the Sanhedrin, visiting from Jerusalem
- Educated and sincere in his faith
- Open to questioning and wrestling with doubt
- Confronted by evil he cannot address through his religious framework
- Constrained by religious performance expectations

His conversation with his wife Zohara contains profound theological reflection. Using a cheap mirror as illustration, he wonders if Torah itself might be like a "blurry reflection" of a more beautiful reality. Her immediate response - "Never utter those things in public" and "That might even be blasphemy" - captures the tension between authentic spiritual seeking and institutional religious expectations.

Marty deeply identifies with Nicodemus, stating he represents the tension of being a religious leader who wrestles with questions that others find threatening.

##### Simon Peter: Desperation and Moral Compromise

The episode portrays Peter as a desperate fisherman willing to compromise Torah observance to avoid financial ruin. While Marty expresses strong disagreement with making Peter a "scoundrel" who doesn't care about God, he appreciates the character development that follows.

**Peter's Situation**:
- Facing crushing tax debt that threatens to cost him his fishing boat
- Married to Eden (fictional character not in biblical text)
- Engaging in gambling and fighting to make money
- Willing to fish on Shabbat despite serious religious prohibition
- Planning to betray fellow merchants to the Romans for tax relief

The episode suggests that Pharisees made "allowances for fishing on Shabbat if lives are at stake," which Peter tries to exploit. Andrew's response - "Lives are not at stake here" - highlights the moral compromise involved.

This backstory illustrates how economic oppression could drive faithful Jews to desperate measures, though the historical plausibility of fishing on Shabbat remains debated.

##### Matthew: The Outsider's Wealth

Matthew's introduction emphasizes his isolation despite (or because of) his wealth:
- Palatial estate with luxury items (door locks, servant, extensive wardrobe)
- Obsessive-compulsive tendencies (germophobe, analytical, number-focused)
- Publicly despised and spat upon
- Requires transportation through crowds to avoid confrontation
- Lives in fear despite his privilege

Marty particularly appreciates this OCD characterization as a "believable backstory" that explains Matthew's detailed record-keeping in his gospel while making him sympathetic despite his collaboration with Rome.

##### The Socioeconomic Critique: Systems of Oppression

A powerful undercurrent in the episode is how religious leaders like Nicodemus condemn "sinners in the Red Quarter" for failing to keep Torah, while benefiting from systems that make Torah observance nearly impossible for the poor.

As Marty notes: "It's not easy to live in the Red Quarter and follow cleanliness law. It's not easy to live in the Red Quarter and be Torah observant." The Pharisees who point fingers at these "sinners" for keeping the Kingdom away actually "prop up systems that just keep them" in oppression.

This critique has obvious contemporary parallels to religious communities that condemn the poor for moral failures while supporting economic structures that perpetuate poverty.

##### Jesus's First Appearance: Radical Compassion

The episode's climax comes with Jesus's encounter with Mary Magdalene at The Hammer bar (named after Judah Maccabee). The scene is deliberately constructed to contrast with typical depictions of divine power:

**Instead of dramatic entrance**: Jesus enters quietly, without fanfare
**Instead of commanding presence**: He gently places his hand on hers
**Instead of condemning**: He prevents her from self-medicating with compassion
**Instead of displaying power**: He speaks her name with tenderness
**Instead of performing**: He quotes the Scripture her father taught her

The Isaiah 43 passage becomes personally applicable: "Fear not, for I have redeemed you. I have called you by name. You are mine."

Brent contrasts this with the West Wing episode where President Bartlet enters quoting "I am the Lord your God" with booming authority. Jesus's entrance demonstrates that true power often manifests in gentleness, in knowing and naming the broken, in meeting people where they are.

##### The "God Goggles" Debate

Marty expresses his aversion to interpreting Jesus's knowledge of Mary through "God goggles" - the assumption that Jesus simply knew everything because he was God. He prefers to see Jesus's humanity and suggests:

- Jesus was a person of deep prayer who listened to God's voice
- God reveals things to people who are spiritually attuned
- Prophetic gifting allows people to know things they couldn't naturally know
- Jesus could operate in this dimension without it negating his humanity

This theological perspective maintains Jesus's full divinity while preserving the reality of his human dependence on the Father.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Accuracy in Storytelling

The series demonstrates that biblical storytelling doesn't require choosing between accuracy and accessibility. Details like:
- Authentic first-century clothing across all social classes
- Appropriate door lock hardware for wealthy Romans
- The password system at The Hammer bar (friends of Maccabee)
- The use of Hebrew terms like "Shabbat" without always explaining them

These elements create immersion while respecting the intelligence of viewers to engage with unfamiliar cultural elements.

##### When Performance Replaces Authenticity

Nicodemus's question "When did Shabbat become theater?" speaks powerfully to contemporary religious experience. Whenever worship, teaching, or religious practice becomes primarily about maintaining appearances or meeting others' expectations rather than authentic encounter with God, we've fallen into the same trap.

This applies to:
- Church services designed to impress rather than transform
- Religious leaders who can't ask honest questions publicly
- Communities that prioritize certainty over wrestling with doubt
- Spiritual practices done for social validation rather than genuine seeking

##### Economic Pressure and Moral Compromise

Peter's willingness to fish on Shabbat and betray fellow merchants illustrates how economic desperation can lead people into moral compromises they would otherwise reject. Contemporary applications include:

- Workers who compromise ethics to keep employment
- Families who cut corners on religious practice due to multiple job demands
- People who collaborate with unjust systems because they have no alternative
- The poor who are judged for "failing" at standards that economic security makes easier to maintain

##### Ministering to Trauma and Mental Illness

The episode's nuanced portrayal of Mary's condition offers a helpful model for contemporary ministry. Rather than forcing either a purely spiritual or purely medical explanation, it allows for:

- Recognition that trauma, mental illness, and spiritual oppression can coexist
- Compassionate presence rather than formulaic solutions
- Speaking identity and calling rather than focusing on problems
- Meeting people in their darkness rather than demanding they come to the light

##### The Power of Being Known

Jesus's simple act of speaking Mary's name - "Mary of Magdala" - demonstrates the transformative power of being truly seen and known. Applications include:

- Learning and using people's actual names (not nicknames they don't prefer)
- Taking time to understand someone's story before offering solutions
- Recognizing that being known is often more healing than being fixed
- The pastoral practice of quoting Scripture that specifically addresses someone's situation

##### Character Development

1. **Mary Magdalene's "seven demons"** - What might the Gospel writers have meant by this? How do we avoid reducing her to merely her deliverance?

2. **Nicodemus's journey** - What brought him from this beginning to his later appearances in John's gospel (visiting Jesus at night, defending him before the Sanhedrin, bringing burial spices)?

3. **Matthew's transformation** - How does someone move from being a despised tax collector to a gospel writer? What does his inclusion among the disciples say about Jesus's mission?

4. **Peter's impulsiveness** - While Marty resists the "scoundrel" characterization, how do we understand the biblical Peter's tendency to speak/act first and think later?

##### Literary and Artistic Considerations

1. **Midrash as interpretation** - What are the strengths and limitations of using midrashic imagination to fill in biblical narratives? Where are the appropriate boundaries?

2. **Fiction vs. Scripture** - How do we enjoy creative biblical storytelling while maintaining Scripture's unique authority?

#### Personalized Summary

This episode of BEMA launches an exciting new series examining The Chosen through the lens of historical context and theological reflection. What strikes me most is how the show succeeds where so many biblical productions fail - by embracing its nature as dramatic fiction rather than trying to be Scripture on screen. This freedom allows for rich character development that makes the biblical world come alive.

The portrayal of Mary Magdalene demonstrates particular sensitivity, refusing to reduce her to stereotypes while acknowledging both the reality of spiritual oppression and the impact of trauma. Her father's death, the Isaiah 43 passage, and Jesus's eventual use of those same words creates a powerful narrative arc that illuminates the gospel without adding to it.

Nicodemus emerges as the episode's most theologically rich character - a sincere religious leader wrestling with the limitations of his tradition. His question "When did Shabbat become theater?" cuts to the heart of religious performance that plagues every generation. His wife's immediate shutdown of his questioning ("Never utter those things in public") reveals how religious systems often protect themselves against honest inquiry, even from devoted insiders.

The socioeconomic critique woven throughout - showing how poverty makes Torah observance difficult while the wealthy condemn the poor for their "failures" - has obvious contemporary relevance. Systems of oppression don't disappear simply because we name them; recognizing them in first-century Galilee should prompt us to examine our own contexts.

Finally, Jesus's entrance at the end provides a masterclass in compassionate ministry. No fireworks, no booming voice, no dramatic demonstration of power - just a gentle hand, a spoken name, and words of identity restoration from Scripture the broken woman learned as a child. "I have called you by name. You are mine." This is the Jesus worth following - the one who sees us in our darkness and speaks life rather than condemnation.

The episode reminds us that the gospel is not primarily about religious performance or moral achievement, but about encounter with the God who knows us by name and claims us as his own, regardless of what systems of oppression - religious or economic - have said about us.

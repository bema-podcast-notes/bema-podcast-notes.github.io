### BEMA 226: The Chosen S1E7 - "Invitations" - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 226 - The Chosen S1E7 - "Invitations"

**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings

**Focus:** Analysis of The Chosen Season 1, Episode 7, covering John 3 (Nicodemus' encounter with Jesus) and Matthew's calling

This episode provides an in-depth discussion of the seventh episode of The Chosen's first season. The hosts examine two primary narrative threads: the famous nighttime encounter between Nicodemus and Jesus (John 3), and the calling of Matthew the tax collector. The episode opens with a flashback to Moses and the bronze serpent (Numbers 21), connecting Old Testament imagery to Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus. The hosts explore themes of faith versus reason, spiritual transformation, and the radical nature of Jesus' invitations to follow him.

#### Key Takeaways

- The bronze serpent story from Numbers 21 presents ongoing interpretive challenges, requiring careful balance between Old Testament context and New Testament connections
- Faith often transcends human reason, as demonstrated in both the Moses narrative and Nicodemus' struggle to understand spiritual rebirth
- Jesus consistently demonstrates full trust in God's story without anxiety or need to control outcomes
- The calling of disciples like Matthew represents radical social disruption - inviting those considered unworthy or unclean into community
- Nicodemus represents the tension many believers face between theological understanding and practical life constraints (family, position, security)
- Documentation of Jesus' teachings by disciples like John provides a plausible model for how the Gospels were recorded
- The phrase "get used to different" captures the essence of Jesus' ministry - constantly overturning expectations and social norms
- True hospitality and generosity characterize Jesus' community, thinking beyond immediate needs to care for future travelers
- Meeting with Jesus constitutes "standing on holy ground," even when the intellectual questions remain unresolved
- The Kingdom of God addresses something much bigger than political liberation - it confronts spiritual death and sin

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Bronze Serpent Narrative (Numbers 21)

The episode opens with Moses crafting a bronze serpent and placing it on a pole, following God's command to heal the Israelites from snake bites. This raises significant interpretive questions:

**Exegetical Challenges:**
- The story appears to contradict typical biblical patterns (looking at an image for healing)
- Reading it through John 3 creates circular interpretation - using New Testament to interpret Old Testament
- The "banner" concept (Adonai Nissi - "the Lord is my banner") may apply, where the pole points beyond itself to God as the true source of healing
- The idea of "looking at what you're most ashamed of" as a path to healing, though poetically appealing, may not be exegetically sound

**Faith vs. Reason:**
Joshua questions the logic of Moses' action. Moses responds that it's not about reasoning but about faith. This establishes a theme that runs throughout the episode - the tension between rational understanding and faith-based trust. The 13th century BC dating represents "bold" scholarship, potentially placing the Exodus on the later side of historical debate.

##### Nicodemus' Encounter with Jesus (John 3)

This scene represents one of the most significant theological conversations in the Gospels:

**The Setting:**
- Nighttime meeting on a rooftop, cloaked in secrecy
- Nicodemus comes as a genuine seeker, not as a trap-setter
- Mary Magdalene vouches for Nicodemus' sincerity, demonstrating her role as a trusted judge of character
- The meeting occurs away from Roman observation despite Quintus' demand to know Jesus' whereabouts

**Key Theological Concepts:**

1. **Born Again/From Above:**
   - Nicodemus initially interprets this literally (returning to mother's womb)
   - The show adds the detail that Nicodemus' mother is deceased, suggesting he would believe it possible if she were alive
   - This demonstrates Nicodemus' willingness to jettison pure reason for faith
   - Distinction between flesh (physical birth) and spirit (spiritual birth)

2. **The Wind Metaphor:**
   - "You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going"
   - Represents the mysterious, uncontrollable nature of the Spirit
   - You can only see the effects, not fully understand the mechanism
   - Nicodemus can understand this intellectually but struggles with practical application

3. **The Bronze Serpent Connection:**
   - Jesus connects his future lifting up to Moses' bronze serpent
   - Not about deliverance from Rome, but deliverance from spiritual death
   - "It's not about Rome. It's about sin" - addressing something bigger than political liberation
   - The bigger kingdom offers bigger freedom than political revolution

4. **John 3:16-17:**
   - Presented in context as part of this intimate conversation
   - Andrew and John listen from the stairs, with John writing down the words
   - Demonstrates plausible mechanism for Gospel preservation

**Nicodemus' Internal Conflict:**

The show portrays Nicodemus as someone intellectually ready to accept the impossible but practically constrained by life circumstances:

- Position as a Pharisee and member of the Sanhedrin
- Family obligations (new grandson, though he shows some ambivalence about missing the bris)
- Age and established life pattern
- Political pressures from Rome (Quintus demanding information)
- Relationship tensions with his wife Zohara, who suspects his sympathies

His final statement captures his dilemma: "My heart is swollen with fear. It could tell me nothing except that I am standing on holy ground." He knows he's encountering something sacred but cannot resolve all the practical obstacles to following Jesus. The invitation remains open - meet at the well on the fifth day (Thursday morning) if he chooses to follow.

##### Matthew's Journey and Calling

Matthew's story in this episode traces his growing internal anxiety about faith and reason:

**Character Development:**
- More deliberate morning routine, showing internal turmoil
- OCD-type tendencies become more pronounced under stress
- Questions his mother about whether impossible things can happen that overturn natural laws
- His mother refuses his money (calling it "blood money") on behalf of his father Alphaeus
- Disconnect from family remains profound (doesn't even ask about his sister)

**The Calling:**
- Jesus simply says "Follow me" as Matthew sits at his tax booth
- Matthew immediately abandons everything - his position, security, wealth
- Gaius tries to reason with him about all he's accomplished
- Matthew's response: willingness to throw it all away
- He unconsciously brings his writing tablet - Jesus notes "there may be some use for that yet"

**Social Disruption:**
- Simon's shocked reaction: "We can't call Matthew!"
- Jesus reminds Simon: "You thought it was crazy when I called you too"
- Key line: "Get used to different"
- Matthew hosts the next dinner party, inverting normal social expectations

**Gaius' Perspective:**
The Roman soldier serves as an outside observer, noting:
- Matthew's mathematical/rational mind has taken him far
- Matthew's response: "I thought they had too" (suggesting his rational approach is now failing him)
- "Your brains have taken you far" becomes prophetic - Matthew needs something beyond pure reason

##### Jesus' Character and Leadership Style

The portrayal of Jesus in this episode emphasizes particular aspects of his humanity and divinity:

**Full Present Trust:**
- No anxiety about outcomes or circumstances
- When the paralytic interrupted his teaching: "How do you know I wasn't done?"
- Regarding Nicodemus meeting: simple trust in Mary's judgment
- Consistent pattern: "It is what it is. This is what God has for me."
- Contrasts with typical "beauty pageant" portrayals that make Jesus barely human

**Hospitality and Generosity:**
- Instructs disciples to leave food for travelers coming after them
- Different lifestyle: not doing things only for themselves
- Creates space for others, even strangers
- This establishes community values that will characterize the movement

**Strategic Teaching:**
- Uses physical touch with Nicodemus (hands, heart) to illustrate flesh and spirit
- More interactive and intimate than typical Pharisaic interaction
- Doesn't treat Nicodemus according to his position but as a genuine seeker
- Meets people where they are while calling them forward

**Radical Inclusion:**
- Calls Matthew despite his profession and social standing
- Tells Matthew he'll host the dinner party - forcing social integration
- Consistently disrupts expectations and norms
- "Get used to different" becomes the paradigm for following Jesus

##### Political Tensions

The episode effectively portrays multiple layers of political pressure:

**Roman Imperial Concerns:**
- Quintus hates crowds: "They take time and resources, and cleanup is a pain"
- Crowds represent control problems - can't manage them like individuals
- Even teaching that draws crowds makes Rome uncomfortable
- Pressure on Nicodemus to report on Jesus' activities
- Demand to know when and where Nicodemus meets Jesus (which he ignores)

**Religious Political Tensions:**
- Nicodemus caught between curiosity about Jesus and Pharisaic position
- His wife Zohara suspects and confronts his sympathies
- The risk of meeting Jesus could cost him everything
- Internal Sanhedrin dynamics and expectations

**Social Disruption:**
- Tax collectors like Matthew are collaborators with Rome
- Calling Matthew threatens group cohesion among disciples
- Simon's strong reaction reveals deep social taboos being crossed
- The Kingdom operates by different rules than both Roman and Jewish society

##### Gospel Authorship and Preservation

The episode offers a plausible model for how the Gospels were written:

**John's Documentation:**
- Shows John writing during the Nicodemus conversation
- Sits on the stairs with Andrew, listening intently
- Andrew asks "Have you ever heard anything like this?"
- John shushes him and keeps writing
- Not overdone or obnoxious, just clever placement
- Provides a believable mechanism for preserving exact words

**Matthew's Tablet:**
- Unconsciously brings his writing tablet when leaving his booth
- Jesus: "There may be some use for that yet"
- Quiet reference to Matthew as Gospel author
- Suggests his detail-oriented, record-keeping nature serves the Kingdom

**Historical Plausibility:**
- No definitive text tells us exactly how disciples kept records
- This imagining respects historical possibility
- Fits with Jewish oral and written tradition practices
- Makes sense given the importance of preserving rabbi's teachings

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Parallels to Nicodemus' Dilemma

Many contemporary believers face similar tensions between intellectual acceptance and practical obstacles:

**Career and Position:**
- Professional positions that might be compromised by radical faith commitments
- Academic credibility versus religious conviction
- Corporate advancement requiring ethical compromises
- The cost of standing against institutional consensus

**Family Obligations:**
- Balancing family security against risky obedience
- Generational expectations and inheritance
- Caring for aging parents while pursuing calling
- Spouse who doesn't share faith convictions

**Social Standing:**
- Reputation in community versus countercultural discipleship
- Established relationships that might be disrupted
- Comfort and security versus radical generosity
- Age and established patterns making change difficult

Nicodemus represents those who intellectually accept Jesus but struggle with the practical cost of following. His story remains open-ended in this episode - the invitation stands, but the choice remains unmade.

##### The "Get Used to Different" Principle

Jesus' ministry consistently overturns expectations:

**In Personal Calling:**
- God often calls those we consider least qualified
- Divine logic differs from human merit systems
- Previous failures don't disqualify from Kingdom service
- Background matters less than willingness to follow

**In Community Formation:**
- Kingdom community includes unlikely combinations
- Former enemies become brothers (Simon and Matthew)
- Social barriers dissolve in Christ
- Hospitality extended to outsiders and sinners

**In Kingdom Values:**
- Generosity over accumulation
- Service over status
- Faith over pure reason
- Present trust over anxious control

**In Modern Application:**
- Church should expect God to work in unexpected ways
- Disruption of our categories signals Kingdom presence
- Comfort with our current understanding may indicate stagnation
- Welcoming "different" people reflects Jesus' ministry pattern

##### Faith and Reason in Tension

The episode explores when faith transcends without abandoning reason:

**Moses and the Bronze Serpent:**
- God's solution doesn't make logical sense
- Obedience precedes understanding
- The mechanism remains mysterious
- Results validate trust in God's command

**Nicodemus' Questions:**
- Intellectual curiosity leads to seeking Jesus
- Willing to question literal impossibilities
- Can't resolve all theological puzzles
- Settles on "standing on holy ground" as sufficient knowledge

**Matthew's Crisis:**
- His rational mind brought professional success
- But reason alone cannot address spiritual longing
- Questions about impossible things preceding his calling
- Abandons security for something beyond calculation

**Contemporary Application:**
- Faith doesn't require abandoning intellect
- But intellectual mastery cannot substitute for trust
- Some Kingdom realities transcend rational explanation
- Mystery and certainty coexist in authentic faith

##### Radical Generosity and Hospitality

Jesus' community practices distinctive care for others:

**Leaving Food for Other Travelers:**
- Planning for those who come after
- Generosity to strangers, not just friends
- Different lifestyle than self-focused living
- Creating culture of provision and care

**Matthew Hosting the Dinner:**
- Those excluded from society become hosts
- Hospitality as tool for reconciliation
- Forced integration across social boundaries
- Table fellowship as Kingdom practice

**Modern Applications:**
- Church as community of radical hospitality
- Resources held loosely for Kingdom purposes
- Thinking beyond immediate circle to wider impact
- Creating space for unlikely people to belong

#### Summary

BEMA 226 provides rich analysis of The Chosen's portrayal of two pivotal Gospel moments: Nicodemus' nighttime encounter with Jesus and the calling of Matthew. The episode masterfully explores the tension between faith and reason, showing how intellectual understanding alone cannot substitute for trust-based following of Jesus.

The bronze serpent narrative establishes the theme of faith transcending reason, creating an Old Testament backdrop for Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus about being born again. Nicodemus represents the intellectually curious seeker who recognizes he stands on "holy ground" but cannot resolve all the practical obstacles to discipleship. His story remains open-ended, with Jesus' invitation standing: meet at the well on the fifth day.

Matthew's calling demonstrates radical Kingdom disruption of social norms. His journey from rational calculation to abandoning everything for an inexplicable invitation shows faith moving beyond what can be computed or controlled. The phrase "get used to different" captures the essence of Jesus' ministry - constantly overturning expectations and including the excluded.

The episode effectively uses dramatic dialogue to portray historical political tensions without claiming specific historicity for the conversations. Roman concerns about crowds, Pharisaic pressures on Nicodemus, and the social taboo of calling a tax collector all create realistic context for Jesus' ministry.

Particularly effective is the portrayal of Jesus himself - fully present, without anxiety, trusting completely in God's story while remaining warmly human and relationally engaged. His hospitality, generosity, and intimate teaching style contrast sharply with typical "beauty pageant" portrayals that make him barely human.

The episode offers plausible imaginings of Gospel formation, showing John writing during significant conversations and Matthew's record-keeping abilities finding Kingdom purpose. While not claiming historical certainty, these portrayals respect the possibility of how disciples preserved Jesus' teachings.

Ultimately, this episode invites viewers into the same choice Nicodemus and Matthew faced: intellectual acceptance can lead to seeking Jesus, but discipleship requires abandoning security for the mystery of following one who stands on holy ground. The invitation remains open, but each person must decide whether the gain outweighs what would be lost.

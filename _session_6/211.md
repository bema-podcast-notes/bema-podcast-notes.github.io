### BEMA Episode 211: Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 211 - John Whittaker: Blue Jeans Theology
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Guest:** Dr. John Whittaker
**Focus:** Conversation about ministry, biblical teaching, and making Scripture accessible for everyday life

This episode features a conversation with Dr. John Whittaker, who holds degrees in theology and ministry from Boise Bible College and Cincinnati Bible Seminary, plus a doctorate in preaching from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. The discussion explores his journey from Bible college professor to church planter and pastor, and finally to creating accessible online resources for biblical discipleship. The central theme revolves around what Whittaker calls "blue jeans theology" - making biblical truth practical and accessible for everyday people in everyday life. The conversation also touches on the courage required to step out in faith at different stages of life and the importance of rooting Christian formation in solid biblical teaching.

#### Key Takeaways

- Biblical teaching must be rooted in real life, not just academic ivory towers - the best theology connects Scripture to everyday experiences and challenges
- "Blue jeans theology" means bringing theological truth down to earth, making it accessible and applicable to ordinary people in their daily lives
- People are hungry for solid biblical teaching but often struggle to access it through traditional means - online audio resources meet people where they already are
- The goal of Bible study should be flourishing life, as pictured in Psalm 1 - being like a tree planted by streams of water, yielding fruit in season
- Stepping out in faith to try new things is valuable at any age - God is more interested in what He does in us than what He does through us
- Creating accessible biblical resources addresses a critical need, especially for new believers who lack basic biblical literacy
- Ministry effectiveness requires both pastoral heart and teaching excellence - caring for people while maintaining scholarly rigor
- God orchestrates seemingly small moments and relationships to shape our life trajectory in remarkable ways
- The fastest growing medium online is digital audio, creating unprecedented opportunities for biblical teaching to reach global audiences
- Holding life plans loosely while remaining faithful to God's calling allows for flexibility when opportunities arise

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Blue Jeans Theology

The central concept Whittaker introduces is "blue jeans theology" - theology dressed in everyday clothes, connected to everyday life. This represents:

- A deliberate choice to make scholarly biblical teaching accessible to ordinary people
- A rejection of ivory tower academics disconnected from real-world application
- An emphasis on how Scripture speaks to the actual struggles and questions people face
- A commitment to translation work - taking complex theological concepts and making them understandable without losing integrity

This approach bridges the gap between academic rigor and practical application, refusing to choose between depth and accessibility.

##### Psalm 1 as Foundational Vision

Whittaker repeatedly returns to Psalm 1 as his foundational vision for ministry and discipleship:

"How blessed is the man who does not walk in the way of the wicked or stand in the path of sinners or sit in the seat of scoffers. His delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law, he meditates day and night. He will be like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruits in season and his leaf doesn't wither and everything he does, he prospers."

This passage shapes his understanding of:
- The source of wisdom for life (the law/word of the Lord)
- The goal of discipleship (flourishing life)
- The means of transformation (meditation on Scripture day and night)
- The outcome of biblical rootedness (fruitfulness in every season)

##### Meeting People Where They Are

A key principle driving Whittaker's resource creation is recognizing how people actually live and learn:

- Modern people are time-pressed and struggle to attend traditional classes or small groups
- Digital audio is the fastest growing medium online
- People listen while commuting, exercising, doing laundry - making use of otherwise "dead" time
- New believers often lack basic biblical literacy and need accessible entry points
- Resources need to be where people already are - on their phones, tablets, and computers

This isn't dumbing down teaching but rather adapting delivery methods to contemporary life patterns.

##### The Journey of Faith Over Career Planning

Whittaker challenges the modern emphasis on having life mapped out and planned:

- Most people don't end up working in the field of their degree
- Life is a journey with unexpected turns we can't see around the bend
- Five-year plans are fine but must be held loosely
- God is more interested in making something of us than accomplishing things through us
- Stepping out in faith and trying new things is valuable at any age
- Failure isn't fatal - you can pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and figure out the next step

This perspective offers freedom from the paralysis of perfectionism and fear of making "wrong" choices.

##### The Pastor-Scholar Integration

Throughout his career, Whittaker has maintained both scholarly rigor and pastoral care:

- Studying at the doctoral level while planting churches and raising young children
- Maintaining professorial excellence while actively ministering to students personally
- Teaching Bible at the college level while engaging real-world struggles through church work
- Creating academically sound resources with practical, accessible delivery

This integration prevents theology from becoming disconnected from life while keeping ministry grounded in solid biblical teaching.

##### Discipleship Culture Over Programs

Whittaker emphasizes helping churches shift from "get people in the building" to "get people making disciples":

- Consulting with churches on creating discipleship culture, not just programs
- Focusing on theological and practical principles for discipleship
- Helping churches think contextually about their unique situations
- Working with pastors over extended periods (typically a year) to rethink their entire approach

This represents a fundamental shift in how churches measure success and structure their ministry.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Personal Transformation Through Accessible Resources

Whittaker shares the story of a woman at The Pursuit church who walked out with tears streaming down her face after first hearing him preach, saying she felt "like a kid in a candy store" because for the first time someone was helping her understand the Bible. This illustrates:

- The hunger people have for solid biblical teaching
- How many churchgoers have been attending for years without understanding Scripture
- The transformative impact when teaching connects
- The pastoral responsibility to make the Text accessible

##### The Donut Lady at Safeway

As a 15-16 year old working cleanup in a Safeway bakery, Whittaker received two books from a Christian coworker selling donuts: "The Pursuit of God" by A.W. Tozer and "The Practice of the Presence of God" by Brother Lawrence. These books set the trajectory for his entire life and ministry. This demonstrates:

- How seemingly small acts of faithfulness (giving books to a teenager) can have massive impact
- The importance of spiritual mentors at critical life stages
- How God orchestrates circumstances we can't predict or control
- The power of the right resource at the right time

##### Nigeria Downloads

Sitting in Boise, Idaho, Whittaker sees 130 downloads of his commentary in Nigeria in a two-week span. In a country where persecution of Christians is rising, believers are accessing his resources to deepen their biblical knowledge. This illustrates:

- The global reach possible through digital resources
- Ministry impact far beyond what we can see or measure
- The hunger for biblical teaching in diverse cultural contexts
- How technology enables unprecedented access to teaching

##### Hard Drives to the Philippines

Thirty rural churches in the Philippines use Whittaker's courses, but their internet is too spotty for online access. He downloaded all courses to four hard drives and shipped them to two different islands so churches could share them. This modern-day equivalent of Paul's letters demonstrates:

- Creative problem-solving to meet real needs
- The apostolic nature of resource distribution
- Ministry adaptability to different contexts
- Commitment to accessibility regardless of technological barriers

##### Stepping Out Without Guaranteed Income

Whittaker left a 19-year teaching position at Bible college to join The Pursuit church, which wanted him on staff but couldn't afford him for at least a year - requiring him to raise his own salary. This occurred during his children's expensive teenage years. He did it again when launching his current ministry at age 49-51 with no guaranteed income. These decisions show:

- Faith in action at different life stages
- The risk required to pursue new ministry directions
- God's provision when we step out in obedience
- The courage needed to leave security and comfort

##### Marty Solomon as Student

Whittaker taught Marty Solomon at Boise Bible College in the early 2000s. He remembers Marty as:

- Eager to learn and asking lots of questions
- Willing to challenge status quo and classmates' thinking
- Respectful in his challenges, genuinely seeking understanding
- Interested in where the Text led rather than defending positions
- Coming from a Reformed background but open to learning

This illustrates healthy student-teacher dynamics and the value of challenging questions in learning.

##### Labor and Delivery Writing

Whittaker wrote a chapter of his parenting book and designed the cover while sitting in labor and delivery as his children were having children. This captures:

- The personal motivation behind the book (equipping his own children)
- Working in the margins of life circumstances
- The passion to pass on principles to the next generation
- Making use of unexpected "available" time

#### Personalized Summary

This episode offers a masterclass in faithful ministry evolution and the courage to pursue new directions at unexpected life stages. Dr. John Whittaker's journey from Bible college professor to online resource creator demonstrates that God's calling isn't confined to traditional ministry structures or predictable career paths.

The concept of "blue jeans theology" challenges both the ivory tower academic and the anti-intellectual practitioner. Whittaker refuses to choose between scholarly depth and practical accessibility, insisting that solid biblical teaching can and must be delivered in ways that connect with how people actually live. His commitment to making the Text understandable without dumbing it down models healthy translation work that benefits the church.

Particularly striking is Whittaker's willingness to leave security and step into uncertainty in his early 50s - a time when most people are consolidating rather than innovating. His honest admission that the last two years have been among the hardest of his ministry life adds credibility to his encouragement for others to step out in faith. The reminder that God is more interested in what He does in us than through us reframes both success and struggle.

The global reach of his resources - from Nigeria to the Philippines - demonstrates how technology enables unprecedented Kingdom impact when coupled with faithful content creation. The image of hard drives being shipped to islands because of spotty internet beautifully captures the apostolic nature of resource distribution in the digital age.

Perhaps most importantly, Whittaker's repeated return to Psalm 1 provides a clear vision for discipleship: people flourishing like trees planted by streams of water because they're rooted in God's word. This isn't mere information transfer but life transformation - the goal of all biblical teaching. His various resources (The Bible in Life podcast, Listener's Commentary, parenting book, discipleship consulting) all serve this singular vision of helping people flourish through biblical rootedness.

For BEMA listeners navigating questions about career, calling, and how to engage Scripture faithfully, this conversation offers both permission and challenge - permission to hold plans loosely and try new things, challenge to pursue depth and accessibility simultaneously, and encouragement that God provides when we step out in obedience.

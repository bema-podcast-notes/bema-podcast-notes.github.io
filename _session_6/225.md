### BEMA 225: The Chosen S1E6 — "Indescribable Compassion"

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 225: The Chosen S1E6 — "Indescribable Compassion"
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Discussion and analysis of The Chosen Season 1, Episode 6, covering the healing of the leper and the paralytic

This episode provides a detailed review and theological commentary on the sixth episode of The Chosen series. Marty and Brent explore the cultural context, biblical accuracy, and character development portrayed in the episode, focusing particularly on Jesus's healing miracles, the growing tension with religious authorities, and the developing understanding of the disciples about their calling and purpose.

#### Key Takeaways

- Jesus's compassion transcends social and religious boundaries, as demonstrated in his willingness to touch and heal a leper
- The tension between religious politics (represented by Shmuel) and religious principle (represented by Nicodemus) reflects ongoing struggles in faith communities
- The disciples are still figuring out their purpose and calling, with Simon Peter particularly struggling to understand what "catching men" means
- Our interpretations of Scripture should sit underneath God, not the other way around - we must remain students who never have complete understanding
- Faith that moves Jesus is often the faith of friends advocating for others, not just individual faith
- The Pharisees' theological concerns often cause them to push aside people who genuinely need to encounter Jesus
- Matthew's attention to detail and record-keeping foreshadows his role as a Gospel writer

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Roman Conquest Through Cultural Assimilation

Matthew's line "Conquest is not simply conquering nations, but imposing a way of life" encapsulates the Hellenistic approach to empire-building. Alexander the Great and his successors, including Rome, didn't just conquer militarily - they established infrastructure, introduced Greek/Roman lifestyle, and made conquered peoples love the conquering culture. This was discussed extensively in BEMA Session 3, showing how this approach was more effective than military force alone.

##### The Leprosy Healing and Social Restoration

The episode opens with a man with leprosy attempting to sell tools at a pawnshop, immediately establishing the economic and social devastation of this condition. When Jesus heals him, several important elements emerge:

- Jesus's willingness to touch someone considered ritually unclean breaks social taboos
- Jesus tells him "Don't turn away from me," communicating acceptance and inclusion
- The instruction to "go to the temple, make the sacrifice that Moses required, and then go on your way" suggests God's perspective might be about moving forward into new chapters rather than dwelling on past experiences
- The healed man's overwhelming joy shifts from his disease to normal concerns like clothing, representing complete restoration to community life

##### Politics vs. Principle in Religious Leadership

The Pharisees are portrayed with nuance, showing the internal conflict between:

- **Shmuel** - represents a political approach, concerned with maintaining authority and control, willing to turn in John the Baptist
- **Nicodemus** - represents a principled approach, seeking genuine understanding, willing to question interpretations

This tension reflects historical realities where religious communities must navigate between maintaining institutional power and pursuing genuine spiritual truth.

##### The Authority Debate: God vs. Torah Interpretation

A crucial theological conversation occurs between Nicodemus and Shmuel about whether God is confined by Torah or Torah is subject to God. Key points:

- Shmuel argues that certain things are impossible because Deuteronomy and Exodus say God cannot take human form
- Nicodemus challenges whether Shmuel is limiting God to his own interpretation
- The parallel question for modern believers: Is God subject to the Bible, or is the Bible subject to God?
- Nicodemus emphasizes: "We are still students. All of us, our understanding will never be complete"
- Reference to Sadducees who take only Torah as inspired shows the danger of rigid interpretive boundaries
- "We can walk the ancient path but still be open to new things" - referencing Jeremiah, balancing tradition with openness

##### The Healing of the Paralytic and Faith of Friends

When friends lower the paralytic through the roof:

- Jesus specifically notices and commends the faith of the friends, not just the paralytic
- "Your faith is beautiful" - Jesus is moved by their persistent advocacy
- The Gospel texts emphasize that Jesus saw "the faith of the friends"
- This demonstrates that faith expressed through advocacy and action for others moves Jesus's heart

##### The Mary-Martha Hospitality Tension

Salome's struggle between traditional hospitality duties and being present for Jesus's teaching mirrors the Mary and Martha story:

- Initial instinct is to provide food and physical hospitality
- Gradual realization that spiritual food and presence might be more important
- She attempts to get food from neighbors but eventually accepts that "they're being fed enough"
- Demonstrates the tension between cultural expectations and spiritual priorities

##### Matthew's Character Development

Matthew is portrayed as detail-oriented and precise:

- Knows exactly how long Simon has been behind on taxes (not just "two months" but specific timeframes)
- Knows about the marital exemption extending Simon's grace period
- Explains Roman conquest strategy clearly and concisely
- Peter tells him to "at least grab your tablet" during the miracle, foreshadowing his role as Gospel writer
- His attendance to detail prepares viewers for his eventual role documenting Jesus's life and teachings

##### Jesus's Teaching Method - Repeated Parables

The episode shows Jesus teaching at Zebedee's house using various parables and teachings that appear later in the Gospels:

- The show deliberately doesn't try to place Gospel teachings in chronological order
- Instead, it portrays realistic ongoing discussions with questions and re-teaching
- Jesus likely told the same parables multiple times in different contexts
- People would ask him to revisit earlier teachings
- This approach feels more historically authentic than assuming each teaching was only given once

##### The Disciples' Growing Understanding

Multiple disciples struggle with understanding their purpose:

- **Simon Peter** - wants to "do something" and protect Jesus, doesn't understand "catching men," seeks purpose and action
- **James (the younger)** - was about to join the 288 (Jerusalem choir referenced in 1 Chronicles 25), now uncertain about his future role
- **John** - seems to have better perspective: "If he needed you to know what that meant, he would've told you. Just be you, okay?"
- The disciples are still figuring out what following Jesus means in practical terms

##### Nicodemus's Journey Toward Belief

Nicodemus's progression in this episode:

- Defends John the Baptist's right to preach, seeing no material threat
- Studies Isaiah 40 with Shmuel, drawing connections to John's ministry
- Witnesses the healing of the paralytic with wonder and amazement
- His emotional response is not skepticism but awe at seeing prophecy fulfilled
- Seeks a private meeting with Jesus "in a tomb if necessary" - desperate for understanding
- Represents the seeker who follows evidence and wrestles honestly with implications

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Application of Interpretive Humility

Nicodemus's statement "We are still students. All of us, our understanding will never be complete" challenges modern tendencies toward interpretive certainty:

- Conservative evangelical Christianity often struggles with this tension between confidence in Scripture and humility about interpretation
- We frequently put God underneath our interpretations rather than our interpretations underneath God
- Our finite, fallible interpretations must remain subject to the infinite God
- This doesn't mean abandoning Scripture but maintaining teachability and openness to correction

##### The Danger of Theological Gatekeeping

When Pharisees literally push people out of the window to insert themselves:

- Religious leaders with theological agendas can prevent genuine seekers from encountering God
- The "theology police" prioritize doctrinal debates over people's actual needs
- This happens when religious folk make encounters with God about winning arguments rather than facilitating transformation
- Modern application: How often do churches create barriers to Jesus in the name of protecting truth?

##### Faith Expressed Through Advocacy

The friends lowering the paralytic through the roof demonstrate faith that moves Jesus:

- Their persistence and creativity in overcoming obstacles
- Their willingness to risk social embarrassment and property damage
- Their advocacy on behalf of someone who couldn't advocate for himself
- Modern application: Intercessory prayer and practical advocacy for others reflects this kind of faith

##### Cultural Context for Jesus's Actions

Understanding first-century context enriches the miracle stories:

- **Economic hardship** - The pawnshop scene shows widespread poverty, people returning weekly to pawn possessions
- **Racial-ethnic diversity** - Tamar from Egypt/Ethiopia represents the crossroads nature of first-century Galilee
- **Ritual purity concerns** - Leprosy created complete social isolation; touching a leper was shocking
- **Pharisaic authority** - Limited in certain neighborhoods, showing social stratification
- **Hospitality expectations** - Salome's struggle reflects deep cultural values around providing food for guests

##### Peter's Ministry Personality Type

Peter's characterization offers insight into different ministry approaches:

- Constantly concerned about logistics, safety, crowd control
- Wants action and practical tasks
- Gets "cranked up about the itinerary, the details, who's coming and whether we have enough food"
- Scopes out exits and needs escape routes (introvert tendencies)
- This personality type is valuable but can miss the bigger spiritual picture
- Modern application: Different people serve in different ways; not everyone needs to be contemplative

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **The 288 Jerusalem Choir** - Study 1 Chronicles 25 and the organization of temple worship, understanding what being part of this choir would have meant for James

2. **Leprosy in Biblical Context** - Research the various skin conditions translated as "leprosy," the purity laws in Leviticus 13-14, and the social implications of these diagnoses

3. **Marital Exemption from Military Service** - Examine Deuteronomy 24:5 and its application to taxation and civic duties in first-century Palestine under Roman occupation

4. **Isaiah 40 and John the Baptist** - Study how early Christians interpreted Isaiah 40:3-5 as prophecy about John's ministry preparing the way for the Messiah

5. **The Healing of the Paralytic Across Gospels** - Compare Matthew 9:1-8, Mark 2:1-12, and Luke 5:17-26 to see how different Gospel writers handled this story and what The Chosen drew from each account

6. **Pharisees vs. Sadducees** - Deeper study of these groups' different approaches to Scripture, tradition, and authority in Second Temple Judaism

7. **Nicodemus's Night Visit** - Preparation for the John 3 encounter by understanding Nicodemus's developing curiosity and the risks he takes to seek Jesus

8. **The Sermon on the Mount Compilation** - Investigate how Matthew 5-7 might represent teachings given over time rather than a single sermon, and implications for Gospel genre

9. **Racial and Ethnic Diversity in First-Century Galilee** - Research the crossroads nature of Galilee, trade routes, and the multicultural reality of Jesus's context

10. **Matthew as Gospel Writer** - Study theories about Gospel authorship, the possibility of Matthew writing first (contrary to Markan priority), and the character of Matthew's Gospel reflecting his tax collector attention to detail

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does the conversation between Nicodemus and Shmuel about God and Torah interpretation challenge modern approaches to biblical authority and interpretation? What is the difference between saying "God is confined by Scripture" versus "our interpretations are confined by our understanding of God"?

2. What is significant about Jesus noticing and commending the faith of the friends who lowered the paralytic rather than the faith of the paralytic himself? How does this inform our understanding of intercessory prayer and advocacy?

3. Explain the tension between "politics" and "principle" in religious leadership as portrayed through Shmuel and Nicodemus. How do these same tensions play out in modern church contexts?

4. Why is Matthew's attention to detail (knowing exact timeframes, understanding conquest strategy, etc.) portrayed as significant character development? How does this foreshadow his later role?

5. How does the episode portray the disciples' struggle to understand their calling and purpose? What does John's advice to Peter - "Just be you" - suggest about how we discover our roles in following Jesus?

#### Personalized Summary

This episode of BEMA provides rich commentary on The Chosen's portrayal of Jesus's ministry gaining momentum while simultaneously increasing tension with religious authorities. The healing of the leper establishes Jesus's willingness to transcend social boundaries through physical touch and genuine compassion, communicating acceptance to those society has rejected. The paralytic's healing demonstrates how the faith of friends - their persistent, creative advocacy - moves Jesus's heart, while also setting up the authority conflict with Pharisees who question his right to forgive sins.

The theological conversation between Nicodemus and Shmuel stands out as particularly profound, wrestling with whether God is confined by our interpretations of Torah or whether our interpretations must remain subject to God. Nicodemus's insistence that "we are still students" and "our understanding will never be complete" offers crucial wisdom for modern believers who sometimes confuse interpretive confidence with faithfulness. His willingness to question his assumptions while Shmuel defends rigid boundaries illustrates the difference between politics-driven and principle-driven faith.

The disciples' ongoing confusion about their purpose feels authentic and relatable. Peter wants action and practical tasks, James wonders if his singing matters, and they're all figuring out what "catching men" actually means in practice. John's wisdom to "just be you" suggests that discovering our calling is more about being faithful in who we are than manufacturing some predetermined role.

The episode's approach to Jesus's teachings - drawing from multiple Gospel accounts and contexts rather than strict chronological placement - reflects historical reality more accurately than assuming each teaching happened only once. Jesus likely repeated parables, answered similar questions multiple times, and taught the same truths in various settings. This recognition helps us read the Gospels not as comprehensive chronological records but as curated collections of Jesus's repeated teachings.

Most challenging is the scene where Pharisees literally push people out of the window to insert themselves with their theological questions. This serves as a powerful warning about how religious gatekeeping prevents genuine seekers from encountering God. When we make faith about winning arguments, defending positions, or maintaining control, we risk forcing aside the very people who most need to see Jesus. The tension between Salome's hospitality instincts and her recognition that spiritual food matters more than physical food mirrors the Mary-Martha dynamic, asking us to consider what kind of presence and attention truly serves people in our care.

Nicodemus's journey from defending John the Baptist to desperately seeking a private meeting with Jesus "in a tomb if necessary" demonstrates honest wrestling with evidence and implications. His amazement at the paralytic's healing isn't skepticism but wonder at seeing prophecy fulfilled before his eyes. This kind of genuine seeking - following where evidence leads even when it challenges assumptions - models the intellectual and spiritual honesty required for real faith development.

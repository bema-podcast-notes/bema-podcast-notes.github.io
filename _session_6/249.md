### BEMA Episode 249: Michael Burns — Escaping the Beast - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 249 - Michael Burns — Escaping the Beast
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Guest:** Michael Burns, Teaching Minister at Two Cities Church in Minneapolis/St. Paul
**Focus:** Kingdom politics, allegiance to Christ, and engaging political systems without compromising Kingdom values

This episode features an in-depth conversation with Michael Burns, author of "Escaping the Beast," exploring how Kingdom people should approach politics in the modern world. The discussion examines the tension between withdrawing from political engagement (pietistic approach) and fully embracing culture war politics (evangelical approach), proposing instead a third way rooted in allegiance to Jesus and Kingdom values. Burns shares his journey from history teacher to ministry leader, explaining how his background in pre-Civil War American history and Greco-Roman studies converged with his ministry focus on race, culture, and Kingdom theology. The conversation addresses the challenging question: How do we engage politically without becoming complicit in systemic injustice, while maintaining our primary allegiance to Christ's Kingdom?

#### Key Takeaways

- There is a third way between complete political withdrawal (pietism) and full embrace of partisan politics - a Kingdom-focused political imagination that transcends American political categories
- Faith in Christ can be understood as allegiance to Jesus as King, which by definition makes all other allegiances secondary and challenges national identities and political loyalties
- The early church's proclamation of "Jesus is Lord" was inherently political because it directly challenged "Caesar is Lord" and called people to a completely alternative way of ordering society
- Romans 12-13 should be read together: Chapter 12 outlines Kingdom ethics (love enemies, don't seek vengeance), Chapter 13 acknowledges governmental authority, but verse 8 returns to Kingdom vocation - "let no debt remain outstanding except to love"
- Being made "in the image of God" (not "with" the image) means image-bearing is inherent to our humanity - sin occurs when we strip ourselves of this identity through the lie of superiority and "othering" people
- Anti-discipling through media and culture shapes our worldview more than we realize, causing us to interpret the Bible through political lenses rather than filtering politics through Kingdom vision
- The younger generation (35 and under) demonstrates hunger for Kingdom-focused engagement that addresses injustice without partisan alignment
- Labeling and "othering" people violates the fundamental truth that all humans are image-bearers and transforms "I-you" relationships into "I-it" relationships

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Two Extremes in Christian Political Engagement

Michael Burns identifies two problematic extremes in how Christians approach politics:

1. **Full-Born Evangelical Engagement**: The culture war approach that has characterized evangelical Christianity over the last five decades, where Christians fully embrace partisan politics and attempt to legislate morality through governmental power.

2. **Pietistic Withdrawal**: The approach of completely withdrawing from political engagement, focusing solely on "kingdom matters" and soul-saving while ignoring systemic injustice and oppression.

Burns argues both extremes are inadequate. The pietistic approach, while appearing spiritually pure, is actually a privilege that allows people to ignore injustice that doesn't affect them personally. The evangelical approach compromises Kingdom distinctiveness by aligning Christian identity with partisan political movements.

##### Pistis as Allegiance

Drawing on scholarship from N.T. Wright, Michael Gorman, and especially Matthew Bates, Burns explores the Greek word *pistis* (traditionally translated "faith") as carrying connotations of allegiance and loyalty, particularly when referring to entities like nations or leaders.

This understanding reframes faith in Christ as pledging allegiance to Jesus as King, which historically meant:
- Switching sides from one kingdom to another
- Making all other allegiances secondary
- Living under a completely different set of values and priorities

The connection to *metanoia* (repentance) is significant - this word came from military contexts where enemies were called to "repent" (switch sides) or be destroyed. Early Christian baptismal declarations of "Jesus is Lord" directly challenged the Roman declaration "Caesar is Lord," which is why Christians were charged in Acts 17 with "proclaiming another king."

##### The Image-Bearing Foundation

Burns grounds his political theology in Genesis 1, emphasizing that humans are made "in" the image of God, not "with" it. This preposition is crucial:
- Image-bearing is inherent to humanity, not an add-on or bonus feature
- All humans equally bear God's image regardless of status, race, nationality, or political affiliation
- Sin occurs when we abandon our role as image-bearers and embrace the serpent's lie of superiority

The progression of dehumanization follows this pattern:
1. Buy into superiority of our group (nation, race, political party, etc.)
2. Make other groups inferior
3. "Other" them - create us vs. them categories
4. Label them (liberal, conservative, Marxist, etc.)
5. Transform relationships from "I-you" to "I-it" (Martin Buber's terminology)

Once someone becomes "it" rather than "you," violence and oppression become possible because we've stripped them of their image-bearer status.

##### Discipling vs. Anti-Discipling

Burns introduces the concept of "anti-discipling" - counterfeit formation that shapes us to see the world through non-Kingdom lenses:

**Biblical Discipling** (Matthew 28):
- Teaching everything Jesus commanded
- Helping people see the world through Kingdom eyes
- Becoming more like Jesus

**Anti-Discipling** (antichrist as "instead of Christ"):
- Media and culture formation that shapes worldview
- Creates predictable responses based on news source rather than Kingdom values
- Leads to interpreting the Bible through political ideology rather than filtering politics through Scripture

The diagnostic question: Can you predict someone's position on issues more accurately based on their media consumption than on their claim to follow Jesus?

##### Romans 12-13 as Integrated Teaching

Burns challenges the common practice of divorcing Romans 12 from Romans 13:

**Romans 12** - Kingdom Vocation:
- Love is sincere
- Devoted to one another
- Love your enemies
- Don't seek vengeance
- Overcome evil with good

**Romans 13** - Governmental Authority:
- Be subject to governing authorities
- God uses nations to maintain peace and justice to a degree
- Governments have a legitimate role in keeping order

**Romans 13:8** - Return to Kingdom Vocation:
- "Let no debt remain outstanding except to love"
- Kingdom people's primary calling is to demonstrate what love looks like in each situation

The Kingdom role is showing an alternative to governmental systems while also holding those systems accountable to their calling of bringing justice and peace. Nations have a place, but Kingdom people demonstrate a better way.

##### The Life of the Age to Come

Burns emphasizes the concept of *zoe aionios* (often translated "eternal life" but more accurately "life of the age to come"):
- Jesus brought the future age breaking into the present
- Kingdom people live now as though in God's presence
- Demonstrates to the world what the future with God will look like
- Enables living God's will "on earth as it is in heaven"

This understanding shifts Christian purpose from merely having successful lives or fighting for the oppressed to living out Kingdom vision - doing justice through the way of the Lamb, which creates inherent tensions:
- Stand up for the oppressed while loving enemies
- Refuse to exercise power over others while advocating for justice
- Lay down your life while confronting systemic evil

##### Sankofa - Journey Back to Move Forward

Burns references the Ghanaian concept of *sankofa* (depicted by a bird retrieving a seed off its back) - the principle that to understand your present and move forward, you must first journey back and understand the past.

Applied to Scripture:
- Understanding historical context is essential for proper interpretation
- Without historical understanding, we miss what texts are actually addressing
- Example: 1 Corinthians 6 isn't simply prohibiting lawsuits but addressing social inequity in the Roman court system

Applied to American context:
- Understanding our historical myths and realities is necessary for Kingdom engagement
- The myth of American innocence prevents clear Kingdom vision
- The blurring of the Kingdom of God with the United States makes it difficult to see things clearly

##### The Three Parts of "Escaping the Beast"

Burns structures his book in three sections:

**Part One - History**: Examines the historical context of Revelation and the early church's relationship with Roman imperial power. Establishes parallels between the Roman Empire and contemporary contexts.

**Part Two - Bridge**: Connects the historical context to the modern American context, showing how similar dynamics of empire, power, and allegiance operate today.

**Part Three - Practical Application**: Boldly attempts to practically apply Kingdom principles to specific political issues and questions. Burns acknowledges this section is most open to disagreement (he suggests 30% might be wrong) but argues someone needs to start the conversation with concrete proposals.

#### Examples & Applications

##### The Peter-Paul Political Argument (Chapter 12)

Burns creates a fictional manuscript depicting Peter and Paul arguing about whether Nero or Claudius was a better emperor. After presenting this "discovered text," he reveals it's made up and asks: Can you imagine Peter and Paul having such an argument?

The answer should be no - but we can easily imagine 21st-century disciples having exactly such arguments about contemporary political leaders. This illustration exposes how much partisan political identity has infiltrated Christian community in ways that would have been unthinkable for early Christians whose primary identity was Kingdom allegiance.

##### The Privilege of Pietism

When Marty shares his own journey from pietistic separation ("Kingdom and politics are separate things"), someone confronted him about his privilege - pointing out that he was in a position where stepping away from politics didn't really impact him. This challenged the assumed spiritual purity of political disengagement.

Application: Those most affected by unjust policies cannot afford the luxury of "staying out of politics." For Kingdom people to withdraw from political engagement while others suffer from systemic injustice is not spiritual neutrality but privileged complicity.

##### 1 Corinthians 6 and Roman Courts

Without understanding the historical context, 1 Corinthians 6 appears to be a simple prohibition against Christians taking each other to court. However, understanding the Roman court system reveals:
- Courts were structured to favor the wealthy and powerful
- The legal system perpetuated and reinforced social inequity
- Paul's instruction challenges the social inequity itself, not just the act of litigation

Application: Many biblical passages that seem to be about individual moral choices are actually addressing systemic injustice and calling for Kingdom alternatives to corrupt systems.

##### The Early Church's Political Witness

If the early church had simply proclaimed: "We want to tell you about a new God who died for your sins. If you believe, you'll go to heaven when you die," Rome wouldn't have cared. Rome was religiously inclusive.

What caught Rome's attention:
- Proclaiming Jesus (not Caesar) as Lord
- Upending economic injustices
- Challenging social inequities
- Blurring status lines
- Living together as family across social boundaries
- Creating an alternative way of ordering society

Application: When the modern church focuses exclusively on personal salvation and afterlife, we lose the politically challenging dimension that characterized early Christianity. The full gospel includes both forgiveness of sins and Kingdom allegiance that restructures all relationships and systems.

##### Media Consumption as Formation

Burns suggests a diagnostic test: Can you predict where people will come down on issues and how they'll treat other people more accurately based on what news media they watch than whether they follow Jesus?

If yes, this indicates anti-discipling is more formative than Kingdom discipleship.

Application: We must examine what is actually forming our worldview. Are we taking "captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ" (2 Corinthians 10:3-5), or are we absorbing worldly frameworks uncritically and then reading the Bible through those lenses?

##### The Civil War Question

Burns' historical passion for pre-Civil War America raises the driving question: How do we develop a political ideology from the Bible that would have addressed slavery rather than being silent or complicit?

This question prevents both extremes:
- Full partisan engagement that baptizes one political ideology
- Pietistic withdrawal that ignores injustice in the name of spiritual purity

Application: Any Kingdom political theology must be robust enough to prophetically challenge systemic evil like slavery, not just focus on individual piety or align with existing power structures.

##### The Younger Generation's Hunger

Burns observes that people 35 and under are animated by Kingdom vision in unique ways - they hunger for addressing injustice while maintaining Kingdom focus. When they discover there's a way to do both, they pursue it passionately.

This isn't because they're more spiritual or holy, but because of historical and cultural factors converging:
- Awareness of myth of American innocence
- Exposure to diverse perspectives
- Skepticism toward institutional Christianity aligned with power
- Desire for authentic faith that makes a difference

Application: The church should pay attention to what animates younger generations rather than dismissing their concerns. Their hunger for Kingdom-focused justice engagement may be exactly what's needed for this moment in history.

##### The Labeling Trap

Burns describes how labeling works:
- You're a liberal / conservative / Democrat / Marxist / socialist / etc.
- Once labeled, you're quantified and "othered"
- Relationship shifts from "I and you" to "I and it"
- Person becomes a category rather than an image-bearer

This happens across the political spectrum - both "sides" engage in labeling and othering.

Application: Before assigning a political label to someone, remember they are made in God's image. The category we place them in should be "image-bearer" and "you" before any political designation.

5. **The Third Way**: Burns proposes a third way between pietistic withdrawal and full partisan political engagement. What characterizes this third way? Why are both extremes inadequate from a Kingdom perspective? How do we practically navigate this third way in specific political situations?

#### Personalized Summary

This conversation with Michael Burns challenges us to reconsider the very foundations of how Kingdom people engage with politics. Rather than accepting the false dichotomy between withdrawing from political life or fully embracing partisan politics, Burns invites us into a more difficult but more faithful third way - one rooted in allegiance to Jesus as King that transcends American political categories entirely.

The most provocative insight may be understanding faith as allegiance. When early Christians declared "Jesus is Lord" at baptism, they weren't simply making a personal spiritual commitment - they were pledging loyalty to a King in direct opposition to Caesar. This wasn't a private religious belief but a public political statement that called them to an entirely alternative way of ordering society. Our faith should similarly challenge us to see Jesus's Kingdom, not as complementary to our political ideology, but as the primary allegiance that judges and transforms all other commitments.

Burns' emphasis on image-bearing provides the theological foundation for resisting the "othering" that dominates contemporary political discourse. Every human being - regardless of political affiliation, race, nationality, or status - bears God's image inherently. When we label, categorize, and "other" people, transforming "I-you" relationships into "I-it" relationships, we participate in the serpent's lie of superiority and strip both ourselves and others of our image-bearing vocation. This is perhaps the most direct application to our current moment, where political tribalism has led to unprecedented division even within the church.

The concept of "anti-discipling" exposes how thoroughly our worldviews are shaped by media and culture rather than Kingdom vision. If we can predict someone's political positions more accurately based on their media consumption than their claim to follow Jesus, something has gone deeply wrong. We're being discipled by MSNBC or Fox News, by social media algorithms and cultural assumptions, rather than by the way of Jesus. This calls for a radical reexamination of what's forming us and a commitment to taking "captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."

Reading Romans 12-13 as integrated teaching rather than separated instructions provides a framework for engagement. Kingdom people are called to the Romans 12 ethic - loving enemies, not seeking vengeance, devoted to one another - while acknowledging that governments have a role in maintaining justice and order. But we never forget that our primary vocation, stated in Romans 13:8, is love. The question for Kingdom people in every political situation is not "which party is right?" but "what does love look like here?"

Burns' willingness to attempt practical application in Part Three of his book, while acknowledging he could be 30% wrong, models the kind of humble engagement we need. He's not claiming to have unlocked the definitive biblical political platform but rather starting a conversation, throwing down the first thought for others to build on, challenge, and refine. This is the kind of gracious but engaged dialogue the church desperately needs.

The call is clear: We must develop a Kingdom political imagination robust enough to address systemic injustice without compromising our allegiance to Jesus. We must engage without withdrawal (which is often privilege in disguise) and without full partisan alignment (which compromises Kingdom distinctiveness). We must remember that all humans bear God's image and resist the labeling and othering that characterizes worldly politics. We must be formed by Kingdom vision rather than cultural anti-discipling. And we must hold our political positions humbly, recognizing that we're all learning to see what the Kingdom looks like in these complex situations.

This is difficult, tension-filled work with no simple formulas. But it's the work of being the church - demonstrating to the world an alternative way of being human, ordered not by power and partisanship but by the way of the slain Lamb, the party of Jesus, the Kingdom that has broken into this present age and invites us to live now as though in God's future presence.

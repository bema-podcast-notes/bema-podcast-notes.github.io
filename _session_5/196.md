### BEMA Episode 196: AD 700-1000 - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 196 - AD 700-1000
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** The Iconoclastic Controversy, East-West Schism, and the rise of Charlemagne

This episode covers three pivotal centuries (700-1000 AD) in Christian history, examining the growing tensions between Eastern and Western Christianity that culminated in the Great Schism of 1054. The discussion explores fundamental differences in how Eastern and Western cultures communicate truth, the controversy over icons versus doctrine, and the influence of key figures like Charlemagne and Boniface in shaping medieval Christianity. The hosts also provide important context about the concept of "Christendom" and its implications for understanding church history.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Iconoclastic Controversy revealed fundamental differences between Eastern and Western approaches to preserving and communicating biblical truth
- Eastern Christianity used icons (images) to communicate truth, while Western Christianity emphasized creeds, doctrines, and written definitions
- The Great Schism of 1054 divided Christianity into the Roman Catholic Church (West) and the Eastern Orthodox Church (East), though the process was gradual and complex
- Charlemagne is called the "Father of the West" for uniting Western Christianity in ways not seen since Constantine
- The "Dark Ages" were not entirely dark but included significant intellectual and spiritual developments that laid groundwork for later progress
- Most people in this era were illiterate and separated from direct access to Scripture, which was preserved primarily in Latin (West) or Greek (East)
- The term "Christendom" refers to Christianity intertwined with political power and empire, beginning with Constantine
- Neither Eastern nor Western approach is entirely right or wrong; they represent different cultural methods of engaging with faith and truth

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Eastern vs. Western Worldviews

The fundamental distinction explored in this episode centers on how different cultures communicate truth. This concept was introduced in BEMA Episode 0 and becomes critical for understanding the Iconoclastic Controversy.

**Western Approach:**
- Communicates truth through words, definitions, and prose
- Emphasizes creeds and doctrinal statements
- Values precision in language and theological formulation
- Creates systematic theology through written documents
- Tendency toward what could be called "doctrinal idolatry"

**Eastern Approach:**
- Communicates truth through pictures, images, and narrative
- Emphasizes icons as visual theology
- Values story and experience alongside intellectual knowledge
- Preserves truth through visual representation and liturgy
- Roots in the biblical world's oral and visual culture

##### The Iconoclastic Controversy

This controversy emerged from the Byzantine Church's use of images and icons in worship, leading to significant conflict between Eastern and Western Christianity.

**The Eastern Position:**
- Icons are not objects of worship but windows to the divine
- The worshiper venerates the God behind the story the icon represents
- Icons serve as "books" for the illiterate, teaching biblical narratives
- This approach connects to the Eastern world of the Bible, which used images to convey truth
- Icons help preserve and remember the content of Scripture in a pre-printing press world

**The Western Critique:**
- To Western eyes, praying before icons appeared to be blatant idolatry
- The practice seemed to violate commandments against graven images
- Westerners preferred preserving truth through written doctrine
- This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of Eastern worship practices

**Historical Context:**
The controversy must be understood within the practical realities of the time:
- No printing press meant limited distribution of written texts
- Most people were illiterate
- Church services conducted in languages people didn't speak (Latin in the West, Greek in the East)
- The Jewish educational system that had preserved Scripture orally had been removed from Christian practice
- Both Eastern and Western approaches attempted to solve the same problem: how to preserve biblical truth

##### Charlemagne and Western Unity

Charlemagne (reign approximately 768-814 AD) emerged as a transformative figure who united Western Christianity.

**Contributions:**
- United the Western Church in ways not seen since Constantine
- Led the church toward productive Renaissance
- Urged intellectual and spiritual revitalization
- Created momentum that would eventually lead to the scientific revolution
- Brought stability during a tumultuous period

**Legacy:**
- Called the "Father of the West"
- His work can be viewed with either admiration or critical eyes
- The unity he achieved was significant but ultimately could not hold under East-West tensions
- His influence helped make the Middle Ages more productive than commonly believed

##### The Great East-West Schism (1054 AD)

The formal split between Eastern and Western Christianity represents one of the most significant fractures in church history.

**Key Points:**
- Traditional date is 1054 AD, though the process was gradual
- Some historians argue it wasn't finalized until 1472
- The split was not a single moment but an ongoing process
- Communication challenges of the era meant the schism's implications took time to fully realize

**Causes:**
- Fundamental differences in worldview (Eastern vs. Western)
- Controversy over icons and images
- Western papal authority versus Eastern collegial governance
- Growing inability of Rome to control Eastern churches
- Eastern churches "kicking against the goads of Western progress"

**Results:**
- Creation of the Roman Catholic Church (West)
- Formation of the Eastern Orthodox Church (East)
- Western Church experienced shock and terror at losing half the Christian empire
- Many feared Christendom could never survive
- The split continues to define Christianity today

##### Understanding "Christendom"

The hosts provide multiple perspectives on this crucial term:

**Definitions Offered:**
1. New Oxford American Dictionary: "The worldwide body or society of Christians" (generous interpretation)
2. Church History in Plain Language: "Church and state as two aspects of one society - one securing spiritual blessings, the other safeguarding justice and human welfare"
3. Wikipedia: "Christian world, Christian states, Christian-majority countries; refers especially to the Middle Ages and early modern period"

**Marty's Critical Perspective:**
- Christendom represents Christianity with imperial undertones
- It is grounded in empire, beginning with Constantine
- It involves Christianity wielding political and military power
- "Give me the handle end of the sword. Now we're in charge."
- Distinct from the apostolic movement of first-century Judaism
- Christendom may not have ended; it may still exist in different forms today

**Key Questions:**
- Where did Christendom begin? (With Constantine)
- Where did Christendom end? (Has it ended?)
- Even when church and state separated, did the imperial mindset remain?

##### The "Dark Ages" Reconsidered

The Middle Ages, often called the "Dark Ages," deserve a more nuanced understanding.

**Traditional View:**
- Period of intellectual stagnation
- Decline in learning and culture
- Oppressive religious control

**Revised Understanding:**
- Not entirely "dark" at all
- Significant intellectual and spiritual developments occurred
- Figures like Boniface, Charlemagne, and others made important contributions
- This era set up the scientific revolution
- James Hannam's "The Genesis of Science" argues for reconsidering this period
- Liturgical developments (like those from Gregory) created shared Christian experiences

**Reality for Common People:**
- Separation from direct Scripture access
- Illiteracy was widespread
- Church services in Latin (West) or Greek (East) - languages most didn't understand
- Dependence on clergy for religious knowledge
- Life focused on survival: farming, trades, daily work
- Shared liturgy provided common Christian experience despite literacy barriers

#### Examples & Applications

##### Real-World Example: Visiting an Eastern Orthodox Church

Brent shares his experience visiting Eastern Orthodox churches with friends in high school, describing them as "very moving experiences." This illustrates how encountering different Christian traditions can broaden understanding.

**For Modern Western Christians:**
If a Western Protestant or Catholic walked into an Eastern Orthodox church today, they might observe:
- Extensive use of icons and images throughout the sanctuary
- Worshipers praying at stations before icons
- Kneeling before images
- Use of incense and ritual
- Highly liturgical worship
- Different approach to Scripture reading and teaching

**The Misunderstanding:**
A Western observer might immediately think "idolatry!" But this reflects a misunderstanding. Eastern worshipers are not worshiping the icon itself but encountering God through the narrative the icon represents.

**The Parallel:**
Just as Easterners don't worship icons, Westerners don't worship their doctrinal statements - though the line may be fine. Both are methods of encountering and preserving truth about God.

##### Practical Example: Preserving Truth Without Printing

The episode highlights a critical problem facing medieval Christianity: how to preserve biblical truth in a pre-printing press world where most people were illiterate.

**The Eastern Solution:**
Create icons - visual representations of biblical narratives. An illiterate farmer could "read" the story of Jesus's birth, crucifixion, or resurrection through images. The icon becomes a book for those who cannot read words.

**The Western Solution:**
Write down what the text says in creeds and doctrinal statements. Train clergy to preserve and transmit this knowledge. Create systematic theology that can be memorized and recited.

**Modern Parallel:**
Today we face similar questions about preserving and transmitting truth across cultural and linguistic barriers. Bible translation movements, oral Bible storytelling projects, and visual Bible resources all grapple with how to make Scripture accessible to different learning styles and cultural contexts.

##### Historical Application: Gregory's Liturgical Reforms

Referenced from the previous episode, Gregory's contribution of shared liturgy provided a common Christian experience even when people couldn't read Scripture themselves. This shows how church leaders attempted practical solutions to real problems:
- People couldn't read
- Scriptures weren't available in multiple copies
- Church used languages people didn't speak
- Solution: Create a standardized worship experience that could be shared across regions

##### The Boniface Example

The hosts mention Boniface as someone who helped unite order under a struggling papacy. This illustrates how individual leaders made significant contributions during turbulent times. Boniface represents the kind of figure worth studying more deeply - someone who worked to bring stability and unity during the fragmenting period between 700-1000 AD.

#### Summary

BEMA Episode 196 covers three crucial centuries (700-1000 AD) that witnessed fundamental fractures in Christian unity. The episode reveals that beneath the political and theological conflicts of this era lies a deeper cultural divide: the difference between Eastern and Western ways of knowing and communicating truth.

The Iconoclastic Controversy was not simply about whether images were appropriate in worship. It represented a clash between the Eastern world's use of visual narrative and story versus the Western world's preference for written definitions and doctrinal precision. Both approaches attempted to solve the same pressing problem - how to preserve biblical truth in a world without printing presses, where most people were illiterate and separated from Scripture by language barriers.

Charlemagne emerges as a pivotal figure who united Western Christianity and spurred intellectual revival, earning him the title "Father of the West." His influence helped make the Middle Ages more productive than traditionally believed, setting foundations for later developments like the scientific revolution.

The Great Schism of 1054 formalized what had been growing tensions, splitting Christianity into Roman Catholic (West) and Eastern Orthodox (East) traditions. This division, while dated to 1054, was actually a gradual process reflecting deep cultural and theological differences that had been building for centuries.

The episode challenges listeners to reconsider both the "Dark Ages" (which weren't entirely dark) and the concept of "Christendom" itself. The hosts encourage critical examination of Christianity's entanglement with empire and power, asking whether this imperial version of faith continues today even after the formal separation of church and state.

Most importantly, the episode calls for humility in recognizing that neither Eastern nor Western approaches have a monopoly on truth. Both represent different cultural methods of engaging with faith, each with strengths and limitations. Understanding this history helps modern Christians appreciate the diverse ways people encounter and express their faith in Jesus across cultures and throughout time.

### BEMA Episode 204: Session 5 Capstone - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 204: Session 5 Capstone
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Conclusion of Session 5 and transition to future BEMA content

This episode serves as the official conclusion to BEMA's foundational five sessions, marking a significant transition point in the podcast's journey. Rather than providing new historical or biblical content, Marty and Brent reflect on the transformative nature of the journey listeners have taken through understanding Scripture in its historical and cultural context. The episode features two powerful readings from Sarah Bessey's books "Out of Sorts: Making Peace With an Evolving Faith" and "Jesus Feminist," offering benediction and commissioning for listeners as they continue their faith journey. The hosts also provide practical information about upcoming content, including the planned Session 6 called "Postscripts" and various new formats they hope to explore.

#### Key Takeaways

- Session 5 represents the completion of BEMA's foundational core material, not the end of the podcast itself
- The journey of faith is ongoing and involves continually sorting through beliefs, letting go of certainties, and growing deeper in relationship with God
- Session 6, tentatively titled "Postscripts," will continue with various topics, miniseries, and possibly guest appearances
- The process of theological transformation is like a wilderness journey where we shed unnecessary baggage and discover what truly matters
- Listeners are commissioned as ministers of the gospel, called to live out their faith in whatever context God has placed them
- Community, authenticity, and continuing to ask questions are essential elements of faithful discipleship
- The BEMA community extends beyond the podcast through the Slack workspace and continued engagement with the material
- Supporting the ministry financially enables the creation of more content and resources for the community

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Wilderness Journey of Faith

Sarah Bessey's "Benediction" presents faith transformation as a wilderness journey, using the metaphor of unpacking boxes and sorting through belongings. This framework captures several important dynamics:

**The Sorting Process:** Believers carry theological baggage, doctrinal certainties, apologetic arguments, and carefully constructed worldviews. The journey of growth requires examining each piece and determining what to keep and what to leave behind. This isn't a one-time event but an ongoing process.

**The Trail of Transformation:** As we journey, we leave behind "poisonous, lovely things" - beliefs and practices that may have once seemed essential but ultimately hinder spiritual growth. The items left along the trail include cynicism, hypocrisy, lies, numbing techniques, apologetics used as weapons, rigid doctrinal statements, pomposity, carefully constructed personas, and even our own righteousness.

**Unexpected Attachments:** Some things we thought we'd discard become precious. Conversely, things we held tightly we discover were unnecessary burdens. The journey reveals what truly matters and what was merely religious performance.

**The Stripping Process:** Eventually, the wilderness journey removes everything that stands between us and God. This complete vulnerability, while terrifying, leads to genuine freedom and intimacy with God.

**Perpetual Journey:** Even after one wilderness journey, the call comes again to venture further west. Growth in faith is not a destination but a lifelong adventure of discovery.

##### Fear Versus Love as Motivators

The benediction addresses a crucial distinction in spiritual formation:

**Fear-Based Faith:** Many Christian communities motivate behavior through fear - fear of hell, fear of God's punishment, fear of the "slippery slope," fear of being wrong, fear of asking questions. This creates a religious system built on control and anxiety.

**Love-Based Faith:** Scripture teaches that "perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love." A mature faith is motivated by love for God, love for others, and the security of knowing we are loved by God.

**The Slippery Slope Redemption:** Rather than avoiding the "slippery slope" of questioning and growth, Bessey suggests it "may very well be your saving grace, sending you careening into truth and love, newness and beauty."

##### Kingdom Living in Exile

The benediction addresses the tension of living as kingdom people in a world that often feels foreign:

**Exilic Identity:** Believers may feel like exiles, not fully at home in the world's systems or in traditional religious structures. This feeling is validated rather than condemned.

**Present and Future Kingdom:** There's a danger of being "so caught up in the 'not yet' of the Kingdom of God that you forget it's also now." The kingdom isn't only a future hope but a present reality we participate in creating.

**Active Participation:** Like the exiles in Babylon, we're called to "plant gardens in your exile, work for the good of your city." We don't withdraw from the world but actively work for shalom and justice right where we are.

##### The Commissioning to Ministry

Sarah Bessey's "The Commissioning" from "Jesus Feminist" reframes what it means to be called to ministry:

**Universal Calling:** Every believer is commissioned as "a minister of Jesus Christ, to live in your world as an ambassador of the kingdom." Ministry isn't reserved for professionals with seminary degrees or official positions.

**God-Breathed Worth:** Our value doesn't come from accomplishments, gender, marital status, correct doctrine, or approval from gatekeepers. We have inherent worth as image-bearers of God.

**Waiting to Be Validated:** Many people wait for someone in authority to tell them they matter, they have a voice, they are called. The commissioning declares: "Stop waiting for someone else to validate your created self. That is done."

**Ministry in Context:** The call to ministry isn't a call to leave your current life but to recognize the sacred purpose in your actual circumstances. Whether surrounded by toddlers or thousands, in a hospital or kitchen, giving voice to dozens or one soul - you are a minister.

**The Work of Liberation:** Ministry involves "the daily work of liberation and love" - putting things right, calling forth what will be, extending freedom and grace, living counter-culturally when culture (religious or secular) doesn't affirm truth, love, mercy, and justice.

##### Community and Belonging

Both readings emphasize the critical role of authentic community:

**Messy Community:** Prayer for "community so rich, so deep, so diverse, that you will disagree and fight and remain in fellowship together anyway." Real community involves conflict, forgiveness, and staying together through difficulty.

**Mutual Dependence:** "We need you and your voice, your experience and your wisdom. We need your talents and your failures." The body of Christ is incomplete without each member's unique contribution.

**Radical Inclusion:** The commitment to not give up on radical inclusion, constantly reminding one another: "You belong here. There's room for you. There's room for all of us."

**Teachers All Around:** "May you remember that you have so much to learn and treat the people in your life as your teachers." This humility opens us to receive wisdom from unexpected sources.

##### Scripture and the Holy Spirit

The benediction reclaims healthy engagement with Scripture and the Spirit:

**Bible Reclamation:** For those who have experienced Bible abuse or had Scripture weaponized against them, there's prayer for healing and for Scripture to "capture your imagination and heart again."

**Active Leading:** Prayer for "the active and intimate leading of the Holy Spirit... signs and wonders, for dreams and visions, for miracles and intimacy." This embraces the full charismatic work of the Spirit.

**Not Outsourcing:** "Don't outsource the work of the Holy Spirit in your life to someone else." Each person must do their own spiritual work rather than relying entirely on pastors or teachers.

**Scripture Shaping Life:** "May scripture shape your prayers with stories and truth, promises and declarations, poems, and metaphors." The Bible becomes a living resource rather than a rule book.

##### Future of BEMA

The episode provides practical information about what comes next:

**Session 6 "Postscripts":** Unlike the first five sessions which form a cohesive historical journey, Session 6 will be more topical and varied.

**Flexible Format:** Release schedule may vary - weekly, bi-weekly, or other patterns. Content may include miniseries, single-topic episodes, guest interviews, and various experimental formats.

**Video Content:** Marty plans to experiment with YouTube presence, creating video content alongside audio.

**Small Group Resources:** Plans to create video resources for each episode highlighting key ideas for group discussion, though intentionally not creating restrictive discussion questions.

**Community Input:** Many ideas for future content came from the Slack workspace community, demonstrating collaborative content creation.

**Financial Sustainability:** The ministry operates on generosity rather than stepping out in faith and requiring others to carry the burden. Content creation is enabled by monthly donors and one-time gifts.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Personal Faith Journey

The wilderness metaphor applies directly to anyone who has experienced theological transformation:

A person raised in a rigid fundamentalist environment might recognize themselves leaving behind biblical literalism, fear-based motivation, and black-and-white thinking. Initially this feels like loss, but eventually they discover freedom, a more intimate relationship with God, and the ability to read Scripture with fresh eyes. What they feared would destroy their faith actually deepens it.

##### Community Transformation

The vision of messy, diverse community challenges typical church dynamics:

Rather than seeking a church where everyone agrees and looks the same, believers might pursue communities where disagreement is expected and navigated with grace. A healthy small group might include people across political divides, different theological perspectives, and various life stages who commit to staying together through difficulty rather than splitting at the first sign of conflict.

##### Everyday Ministry

The commissioning reframes ordinary life as sacred calling:

A stay-at-home parent changing diapers in the middle of the night without anger is doing ministry. A teacher marking papers while praying for students is fulfilling their call. A business owner creating just economic structures is living out the kingdom. Each person ministers in their actual context rather than waiting for a "real" ministry position.

##### Asking Questions

The benediction validates intellectual and spiritual curiosity:

Rather than shutting down doubts and questions, believers can "delight and wonder and curiosity about your faith about God, and about the story with which you continue to wrestle." Someone questioning traditional understandings of hell, biblical interpretation, or church practice isn't on a dangerous path but may be moving toward deeper truth.

##### Supporting Kingdom Work

The practical discussion of financial support models kingdom economics:

Believers recognize that creating resources, teaching, and building community requires time and support. Rather than expecting everything for free or viewing generosity as transactional, monthly giving becomes a way to participate in kingdom work beyond one's individual capacity. Even small recurring gifts ($10/month) collectively enable significant ministry.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Sarah Bessey's Works:** Read "Out of Sorts: Making Peace With an Evolving Faith" and "Jesus Feminist" in their entirety to engage more deeply with themes of theological transformation and calling.

2. **Wilderness Theology:** Study the biblical theme of wilderness as a place of transformation, from Israel's exodus journey to Jesus's temptation to John's exile on Patmos.

3. **Fear and Love in Scripture:** Do a comprehensive study of how Scripture addresses fear versus love as motivators for faithfulness, including 1 John's extensive treatment of the topic.

4. **Kingdom Theology:** Explore the "already/not yet" tension of the kingdom of God and what it means to live as kingdom people in the present age.

5. **Exile Literature:** Study how biblical exile texts (Jeremiah's letter to the exiles, Daniel, Esther) inform what it means to be faithful in foreign contexts.

6. **Calling and Vocation:** Investigate biblical and theological frameworks for understanding calling beyond professional ministry positions.

7. **The Holy Spirit's Work:** Study the active, intimate leading of the Holy Spirit throughout Scripture and church history, including signs, wonders, dreams, and visions.

8. **Community Practices:** Research historical and contemporary models of authentic Christian community that embrace diversity while maintaining unity.

9. **Discernment Processes:** Learn about spiritual practices for discerning what to keep and what to release in one's theological journey.

10. **Biblical Authority:** Explore healthy frameworks for engaging Scripture with both reverence and intellectual honesty, particularly after experiencing biblical abuse.

11. **Justice and Kingdom Work:** Study the connection between the gospel and work for justice, reconciliation, and putting things right in the world.

12. **Spiritual Formation:** Investigate models of spiritual formation that emphasize transformation over information and relationship over rules.

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does Sarah Bessey's wilderness journey metaphor describe the process of theological transformation, and what are some examples of things believers might leave behind on the trail?

2. What is the difference between fear-based and love-based faith, and why does the benediction pray against fear as a motivator for Christian living?

3. How does "The Commissioning" challenge traditional understandings of who is called to ministry and what validates that calling?

4. What does it mean to live as "kingdom people" in exile, and how does this framework address the tension between the "already" and "not yet" aspects of God's kingdom?

5. How do the hosts envision Session 6 "Postscripts" differing from the first five sessions of BEMA, and what does this reveal about the ongoing nature of learning and discipleship?

#### Summary

BEMA Episode 204 serves as a powerful capstone to the podcast's foundational five sessions, marking not an ending but a transition to a new phase of content and community engagement. Through Sarah Bessey's beautiful readings, the episode frames the BEMA journey as a wilderness experience where listeners shed theological baggage, grow in intimacy with God, and discover authentic freedom in Christ.

The benediction acknowledges the difficulty of questioning, sorting, and growing beyond simplistic certainties while affirming this process as essential for spiritual maturity. It prays against fear-based faith and toward love-motivated discipleship characterized by authenticity, community, and active engagement with Scripture and the Holy Spirit. The commissioning declares that every listener is called as a minister of the gospel, commissioned to live out the kingdom in their actual life circumstances rather than waiting for validation from religious gatekeepers.

Practically, the episode announces that BEMA will continue with Session 6 "Postscripts," exploring various topics through different formats while maintaining the podcast's commitment to teaching Scripture in its historical and cultural context. The hosts invite continued engagement through the Slack community, financial support, and staying connected via the BEMA Messenger. Rather than providing tidy conclusions, the episode sends listeners forward into their own ongoing journey of faith, assured that they belong to a community of fellow travelers and that their unique voice and contribution matters to the body of Christ. The message is clear: this is not the end but a new beginning, and we walk this path together as kingdom people engaged in God's redemptive mission in the world.

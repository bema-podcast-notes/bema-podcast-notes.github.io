- Why does Jesus get baptized? “To tell the world, ‘I am choosing to walk the path correctly.’”
- Back to the beginning. 
- Six steps to bring order out of chaos
  - Chaos Tohu vavohu. 
  - Water
  - Spirit over water
  - God speaks
  - Order is expected
  - Order is tested
  - Tragedy
- Times we see this happen
  - Creation
  - The Flood
  - Exodus
  - Crossing the Jordan
  - Jesus’ baptism
- Trust the Story
  - Know the Text
  - Walk the Text
  - What would have happened if Jesus didn’t know the text? Is it enough to just know the text? It’s important to walk the Text as well. 
  - Satan knows the Text as well. He also misquotes it. How many know the text well enough to notice that?
- The temptations are from the Text. 
  - Matthew orders the temptations differently than the other Synoptics. 
  - These temptations correspond to those texts in the desert with the Israelites after the Exodus when God leads them through shema. Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, and very/might. 
  - God wanted to experience his people through these tests. 
  - Stones to bread: Deut 8:3 and manna… man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.
  - Thrown from the Temple: Deut 6:16 and Water from the Rock in Exo 17… Do not put the Lord your God to the test. 
- We must see the experience of the Israelites as an extension of our own experience. 
  - Not Jews were a failure and Jesus was a success. 
  - However, Jesus shows all of us who seem to follow God how to follow God correctly.

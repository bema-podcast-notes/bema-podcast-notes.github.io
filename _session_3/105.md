- John the Baptist calls out Jesus
  -  Previously, John the Baptist made several strange claims
    - G-d is at the threshing floor
    - The axe is at the root of the tree`
  - This was John's way of claiming that G-d was about to judge the Priesthood.
  - John had a two-part eschatology.
    - The Messiah has come and the end is near. 
    - Once the Messiah comes, there is no time left for repentence. 
    - John's firey passion comes from his eschatology and his understanding of who Jesus really is.
  - Jesus had a three-part eschatology.
    - Jesus knew that his coming was really a new beginning.
    - He knew that the end was not as near and John believed to be.
    - We can tell from his future teachings about the kingdom.
      - The kingdom is a like a mustard seed. A seed that slowly grows. Especially one that would take long enough to hold the "birds" of the air.
      - The kingdom is like a woman baking bread with yeast. The dough slowly rises.
      - The kingdom is like a field of wheat and weeds. Jesus instructed not to pull the weeds, rather to let them grow together (three-part), as to not pull up the wheat with the weeds. Let them grow together until the wheat overtakes the weeds.
  - John asks Jesus if he's the messiah or not.
    - This sounds like it could be doubt but it's possible that it's something else.
    - It sounds like John may be chiding Jesus.
    - More like, "Are you the Messiah or not because you sure aren't acting like it..."
    - Is this the chiding of a former Rabbi?
  - Jesus responds to John
    - *Jesus replied, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see. The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised and good news is proclaimed to the poor. Blessed is anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”*
    - Jesus tells them to go back and report what they see and hear and then quotes scripture. Isa 35:5-6; 26:19; 29:18-19; 61:1. However, he stops short of sharing that the captives will be set free.
    - John will not be freed from prison. He will die there.
- Jesus addresses the crowd about John
  - Jesus claims that John was the Elijah to come.
  - Jesus shares that John was right.
  - John is greatest of any man born of a woman, however, the least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is. Heaven doesn't work the way the world works.
  - The kingdom of heaven has suffering "paratz", it is now exploding.
    - The septuigint replaces the Hebrew perez in the story of Judah and Tamar with the word used here for "violence."
    - The image here is livestock or sheep bursting out of the gate/pen.
  - He who has ears, let him hear. You're going to have to do a little work to dig into to the text and piece together what I'm saying. To find the buried treasure.
  - Jesus quotes Aesop's fable claiming they were warned of what's coming and didn't listen.
- Jesus claims that the world is getting better, not worse.

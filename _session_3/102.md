- Read: Matthew 9:1–13; Mark 2:1-12
- Staying in Mark this week.
- Jesus heals the “paralyzed man” and teaches forgiveness
  - Jesus is in an insula. See the [presentation](https://bemadiscipleship.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/BEMA+080+Silent+Years+Pharisees.pdf) from E.80 Silent Years - Pharisees.
    - There would have been a very large number of people in this house hearing him teach.
    - It would have taken HOURS for the men to dig through the roof. 
  - What’s the purpose for healing and what is its significance?
    - It shouldn’t be a surprise that rabbi’s heal people. Elijah, Elisha, etc. There have been many people who have performed miracles and Jesus isn’t “special” in that regard.
    - While Jesus would heal people out of compassion from time to time, healing, generally, was part of teaching.
    - Jesus FORGIVES the man before he heals the man.
      - Jesus forgives the man BECAUSE HE SAW THEIR FAITH.
        - Faith is visible. It is seen. It influences action.
      - Why does he forgive before healing? It’s likely because that was the main point of his teaching.
        - Jesus’ goal is not to heal, his current goal is to teach. He takes advantage of the opportunity and integrates his teaching into the moment.
        - HEAD QUESTION: Wrestle with that… Do you agree or disagree with Marty? Why? Why not?
      - “Teachers of the Law” were thinking to themselves that Jesus is blaspheming.
        - Mark explains a little extra to his Greco-Roman audience WHY they believe he’s blaspheming which the other Gospel writers do not include (different agendas).
        - Why did they think he was blaspheming? Because he was claiming to be able to forgive when they believed that ONLY GOD was able to do that.
        - This forgiveness is not interpersonal forgiveness, I wronged you so please forgive me. This is bigger than that. 
        - The Sermon on the Mount’s main point is that we’re engaging in the work of forgiveness which is something that the Amidah Prayer (the Standing Prayer) did not ever have.
        - This message is showing up again in Jesus’ teaching.
    - Jesus knew what they were thinking in their hearts… Get up and walk…
      - “Which is easier, forgiveness or healing?” This is where Marty believes he learns that the general teaching is about forgiveness. 
      - Son of Man can mean two things
        - I’m a human being or
        - He’s referencing the book of Daniel.
    - Central images of Daniel
      - Coming on the clouds
      - The first son of man/Adam that deserved justice is Abel. 
      - Jesus teaches that humans have the ability to FORGIVE instead of bringing JUSTICE. 
      - What if Abel returns and forgives instead of giving Cain what he deserves?
      - Is Jesus maybe saying, “I am Abel!”
    - People were in awe when they realized God has given them the authority to forgive. 
      - We are back to the sermon on the Mount and engaging in the act of forgiveness. 
  - Jesus calls Matthew and they eat dinner. 
    - Jewish leaders were upset by this. 
    - Eating together means everything is good between us. 
    - Jesus references Hosea and implies that the Jewish leaders don’t understand what the passage means and they should go study if more. 
    - I don’t want justice, I want mercy…
    - The Jewish leaders don’t misunderstand what Jesus is saying. They get that he believes they misunderstand the text. 
  - God Goggles 
    - Was Jesus reading minds or was he picking up on social cues?
  - Jesus Questioned About Fasting
    - Why do we fast but your disciples do not?
    - Jewish Hermeneutics
      - P’shat: Surface level teaching
      - Remez: The hint to the Text. That is, hints using key words full-on quotations of scripture. 
      - Drash: The deeper and wider meaning of the teaching. This should always align with the P’shat interpretation.

    - What is the P’shat teaching? 
      - I am the bridegroom. You throw the party now and not when I’m gone. 
    - What is the Remez?
      - We have several words to key off of: cloth, garments, patches, tears, wine, wineskins, new and old.
      - Wineskins stands out to Marty. In Luke there are a few options including: Joshua, Job, and, surprise, Jeremiah. 
      - Jeremiah 7, 16, and 25 were mentioned earlier. Right after Jeremiah 16, 17 references a linen belt right in the middle of the wineskin and bridegroom references. 
      - In this passage, we have new and old, bridegrooms, garments, and wineskins. 
      - Condemnation in the Jeremiah story matches the condemnation we find in Matthew’s agenda: Mamzer.
    - What is the Drash?
      - Mamzer takes us back to the Sermon on the Mount.
      - P’shat, Remez, and Drash all align: If you’re not looking out for the mamzer, you’re missing the point.
      - The point has always been mercy, not sacrifice. It’s been justice, compassion and righteousness, it’s always been about blessing all nations, the mamzer. You’re looking for the wrong righteousness and God’s judgment is coming because of it.

    - Jesus is likely teaching a lesson on the Son of Man and forgiveness. Marty admits that he might be making too large of a leap but it’s something he was taught by his teacher.
    - Regardless of those details, forgiveness plays a key part in this lesson and story. Jesus doesn’t just want to heal the man, he wants to talk about forgiveness.

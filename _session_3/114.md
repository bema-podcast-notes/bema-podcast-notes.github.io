### BEMA Episode 114: Fish in a Net - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 114 - Fish in a Net  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Special Guest:** Corey Knadler (@FishGibblets)
**Focus:** Matthew 13:47-52 (The Parable of the Net)

This episode concludes the examination of the Matthew 13 discourse by analyzing the final parable in this teaching series. The hosts explore the Parable of the Net through the PaRDeS method, examining its connection to earlier parables in the discourse and uncovering deep connections to Old Testament texts about God's mission to bless all nations. The discussion reveals how Jesus uses fishing imagery to teach about the kingdom of heaven, the role of angels in final judgment, and the responsibility of God's people to bless outsiders rather than sort between "good" and "bad."

#### Key Takeaways

- The Parable of the Net parallels the Parable of the Weeds, emphasizing that God's people should not attempt to separate "good" from "bad" but should focus on the mission of blessing all nations
- Fish in ancient Jewish thought represent the Gentile nations, making this parable about God's inclusive mission to all peoples
- The angels, not humans, are responsible for sorting at the end of the age, freeing believers from the burden of judgment
- In both the weeds/wheat and fish parables, the good remain while the bad are thrown into the furnace - contrary to "rapture theology" where believers are taken away
- Teachers of the law who become disciples in the kingdom of heaven bring out both new and old treasures, suggesting humility and willingness to learn are essential for understanding God's kingdom
- The fiery furnace imagery connects to multiple Old Testament themes: Daniel's perseverance, Sodom and Gomorrah's failure to show hospitality, and the midrash of Abraham's faithfulness
- God's people are called to bless all fish (all nations) without distinguishing between good and bad, fulfilling Abraham's original calling

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Parable of the Net (Matthew 13:47-50)

The parable describes a net thrown into the lake that catches all kinds of fish. When full, fishermen pull it ashore and separate the good fish into baskets while throwing the bad away. Jesus explains this represents the end of the age when angels will separate the wicked from the righteous.

**Key observations:**
- The net catches "all kinds" of fish indiscriminately, but separation is only into two categories: good and bad
- The angels perform the sorting, not the fishermen/disciples
- The pattern mirrors the Parable of the Weeds where separation happens at harvest time, not before
- The bad are thrown into the "blazing furnace" - the same fate as the weeds in the earlier parable

##### Fish as Symbol of the Gentile Nations

In Jewish interpretive tradition, fish represent the Gentile nations. This understanding comes from several sources:

**Rabbi Akiva's Midrash (40 years after Jesus):** Akiva identified 153 different kinds of fish corresponding to 153 pagan nations known in his day. This wasn't scientific taxonomy but rabbinic interpretation suggesting fish symbolize all the nations of the world.

**Ezekiel 47:6-12 (the key remez):** This passage describes water flowing from the temple into the Dead Sea, making it fresh and full of fish of many kinds. Fishermen will stand along the shore spreading nets. This apocalyptic vision of the end times includes large numbers of fish representing all nations coming to life through God's waters.

##### Angels and the Sorting Process

Both the Parable of the Weeds and the Parable of the Net emphasize that angels perform the final separation. This has profound theological implications:

**Human responsibility is not judgment but mission:** God's people are freed from determining who is "in" and who is "out." Their calling is to bless all nations, leaving discernment of ultimate destiny to God's messengers.

**The good remain, the bad are removed:** Unlike rapture theology where believers are "taken away," biblical parables consistently show the wicked being removed while the righteous remain. This aligns with the vision of God's kingdom being established on earth rather than believers escaping to heaven.

##### The Fiery Furnace: Multiple Layers of Meaning

The "blazing furnace" imagery in verse 50 creates remez connections to multiple Old Testament passages:

**Daniel 3 - Perseverance in the face of idolatry:** Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (Hebrew names: Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah) refuse to bow to idols and are thrown into the fiery furnace. A fourth figure appears with them, traditionally interpreted by Christians as Jesus but more likely understood in Jewish context as Abraham from the well-known midrash about Abraham's faithfulness.

**Genesis 19 - Sodom and Gomorrah:** The first biblical use of "furnace" describes the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The story begins with Abraham and Sarah showing hospitality to strangers (even making bread, connecting to the yeast parable), while Sodom's sin was inhospitality and abuse of strangers. The judgment of the fiery furnace comes upon those who fail to bless outsiders.

**The Abraham Midrash:** An ancient and well-known midrash tells of Abraham being thrown into Nimrod's fiery furnace for refusing to worship fire and standing against idolatry. Abraham perseveres through faithfulness, while his brother Haran, who wants to "hedge his bets" and see who wins before choosing sides, perishes. This story emphasizes perseverance and unwavering commitment to God even in the face of opposition.

##### Teachers Who Become Disciples (Matthew 13:51-52)

Jesus concludes by asking if the disciples understood "all these things," to which they reply "yes." He then describes every teacher of the law who becomes a disciple in the kingdom of heaven as like a homeowner who brings out new treasures as well as old from the storeroom.

**Key insights:**
- Teachers must become learners (disciples) - humility is essential
- The phrase suggests those who "think they know" must be willing to "un-know" and relearn
- Both old and new treasures are valuable - not discarding traditional understanding but being open to new revelation
- Possible remez to Song of Songs 7:13 where the bride says "at our door is every delicacy, both new and old, I have stored up for you, my beloved"
- Connects to the new and old wineskins teaching - new wine requires new wineskins, but both have value

##### PaRDeS Method Applied

**P'shat (Surface meaning):** A net catches all kinds of fish, fishermen separate good from bad, angels will separate wicked from righteous at the end of the age.

**Remez (Hint/allusion):**
- Ezekiel 47 - fish of many kinds, representing nations coming to life
- Daniel 3 - fiery furnace and perseverance
- Genesis 19 - Sodom and Gomorrah's judgment for inhospitality
- Abraham midrash - perseverance in the fiery furnace
- Genesis 18 - Abraham and Sarah's hospitality (bread-making connects to yeast parable)
- Song of Songs 7:13 - new and old treasures stored up for the beloved

**Drash (Application/interpretation):** Jesus calls his followers not to judge between "good fish" and "bad fish" (good Gentiles and bad Gentiles) but to be about the mission of blessing all nations. If they focus on sorting rather than blessing, they miss their calling and fall prey to the same judgment as Sodom and Gomorrah. The wisdom God seeks in his people is the wisdom to know the mission: bless all nations.

##### Connection to Previous Parables in Matthew 13

This parable ties together themes from the entire discourse:

**Parable of the Soils:** The good soil that perseveres and produces a hundredfold (like Isaac who stayed in the land) connects to the perseverance theme in the fiery furnace imagery.

**Parable of the Weeds:** Nearly identical structure - both involve letting good and bad grow together, separation at harvest time by angels, and the wicked being thrown into the fiery furnace.

**Parable of the Mustard Seed:** Birds nesting in the branches represent all nations finding shelter - similar to fish representing all nations.

**Parable of the Yeast:** The woman making bread with yeast connects to Sarah making bread for the strangers, which connects to the hospitality theme contrasted with Sodom and Gomorrah.

**Parable of the Treasure and Pearl:** Corey's insight that God searches for wisdom in his people (the pearl represents wisdom) connects beautifully - the wisdom God seeks is understanding that the mission is to bless all nations.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Church and Evangelism

Many Christians focus on determining who is "saved" or "unsaved," who is "in" or "out" of the kingdom. This parable challenges that approach. Like the fishermen who cast nets catching all kinds of fish, believers are called to extend God's blessing to everyone without attempting to pre-sort. The sorting is God's job through his angels at the end of the age.

**Application:** Focus on loving and serving all people rather than judging their spiritual status. Trust God with the ultimate outcome.

##### Hospitality as Mission

The connection to Abraham and Sarah's hospitality versus Sodom's inhospitality shows that blessing outsiders and strangers is central to God's mission. The judgment of the "fiery furnace" falls on those who fail in this calling.

**Application:** The church should be known for radical hospitality to outsiders, strangers, immigrants, and those different from us, following Abraham's example rather than Sodom's pattern.

##### Humility in Learning

The image of teachers becoming disciples challenges those who think they have mastered biblical understanding. True wisdom involves ongoing learning and willingness to gain new insights while honoring old truths.

**Application:** Leaders and long-time believers must maintain a learner's posture, being open to fresh understanding while respecting traditional wisdom. This prevents spiritual pride and keeps us growing.

##### Perseverance in Faithfulness

The fiery furnace imagery connects to Daniel's friends, Abraham's faithfulness, and Isaac's perseverance. Standing firm in commitment to God and his mission, even when facing opposition or cultural pressure, is essential.

**Application:** In a culture that may oppose Christian values or biblical mission, believers are called to persevere with faithfulness like Abraham rather than hedge their bets like Haran.

##### The 153 Fish

While not directly mentioned in this parable, the episode notes that Rabbi Akiva's identification of 153 kinds of fish representing 153 nations appears elsewhere in Scripture as an "extra bonus credit" reference. This likely points to John 21:11 where the disciples catch exactly 153 fish after the resurrection - a powerful image of the mission to gather all nations.

**Application:** The Great Commission to make disciples of all nations is rooted in this ancient calling to bless all the "fish" of the world.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Eschatology and End Times:** How does the consistent pattern of "the good remaining and the bad being removed" reshape understanding of rapture theology and the end times? What does it mean for God's kingdom to be established on earth rather than believers escaping earth?

2. **The Fourth Figure in the Furnace:** Explore the Jewish understanding of Daniel 3's mysterious fourth figure as Abraham (from the midrash tradition) versus Christian interpretation as a pre-incarnate Christ. How do these different readings affect our understanding of the text?

3. **Song of Songs Connections:** Investigate the remez to Song of Songs 7:13 and its connection to Ezekiel 16's image of the blossoming bride. How does bridal imagery relate to the kingdom of heaven parables?

4. **The 153 Fish in John 21:** Study the connection between Rabbi Akiva's teaching about 153 nations and the post-resurrection catch of 153 fish. What is the significance for understanding Jesus's mission and the church's calling?

5. **Nimrod and the Nephilim:** Examine the Jewish midrash connecting Nimrod to the Nephilim and his role as "commander of evil" in rabbinic thought. How does this enrich understanding of the Abraham furnace story?

6. **Hospitality in Torah and Prophets:** Trace the theme of hospitality to strangers throughout the Old Testament, from Abraham to the laws protecting aliens, orphans, and widows. How central is this to God's covenant with Israel?

7. **Matthew's Five Books Structure:** Review the BibleProject's teaching on Matthew's five-discourse structure mirroring the Torah. How does Matthew 13 as the third discourse fit into this framework?

8. **Separation Theology:** Examine how the church has historically focused on separating from "the world" versus Jesus's teaching to be present among all kinds of people. What does healthy discernment look like without judgment?

9. **The Parable of the Soils Revisited:** Re-examine the Parable of the Soils with fresh eyes, looking for connections to perseverance, Isaac staying in the land, and producing fruit through faithfulness rather than immediate results.

10. **New and Old Treasures:** Study the concept of bringing out new and old treasures in the context of Jewish interpretive tradition. How does midrash itself represent this practice of finding new meaning in ancient texts?

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does the Parable of the Net parallel the Parable of the Weeds, and what is the significance of the angels doing the sorting rather than the disciples themselves?

2. What do fish represent in ancient Jewish interpretive tradition, and how does this understanding change the meaning of the parable? Include reference to Rabbi Akiva's teaching and Ezekiel 47.

3. Explain the multiple layers of meaning in the "fiery furnace" imagery, including connections to Daniel, Sodom and Gomorrah, and the Abraham midrash. What common themes unite these references?

4. What does it mean for a "teacher of the law" to "become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven," and how does this relate to bringing out "new treasures as well as old"?

5. According to the drash level of interpretation, what is the primary mission Jesus is calling his followers to in this parable, and how does focusing on that mission differ from attempting to sort "good fish" from "bad fish"?

#### Summary

BEMA Episode 114 concludes the Matthew 13 discourse with the Parable of the Net, revealing Jesus's vision for his followers' mission in the world. Rather than attempting to sort "good" people from "bad" people, believers are called to cast wide nets of blessing to all nations, trusting that angels will handle the final sorting at the end of the age. The fish represent the Gentile nations, connecting this teaching to God's ancient promise to Abraham that through him all nations would be blessed.

The fiery furnace imagery weaves together multiple Old Testament themes - Daniel's perseverance in the face of idolatry, Sodom and Gomorrah's judgment for failing to show hospitality to strangers, and the powerful midrash of Abraham standing firm in faithfulness even when thrown into Nimrod's furnace. These stories emphasize that God's people must persevere in the mission to bless outsiders rather than judge them.

The episode brilliantly demonstrates how all the Matthew 13 parables interconnect, from the yeast and bread-making connecting to Sarah's hospitality, to the good soil's perseverance echoing the furnace stories, to the treasure and pearl representing the wisdom God seeks in his people - the wisdom to know that the mission is blessing all nations. Jesus concludes by calling teachers to become disciples again, humbly bringing out both new and old treasures as they continue to learn and grow in understanding of God's kingdom. This parable challenges modern tendencies toward judgment and exclusion, calling the church back to its fundamental mission of radical, indiscriminate blessing of all peoples.

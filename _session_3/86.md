- Review
  - Matthew: Mumzer Jew to Jews
  - Mark: Roman Gospel Jew to Romans
  - The predominant view is that Mark was written first and Matthew expands on Mark’s gospel when Matthew writes his.
- Luke
  - It is also a popular opinion that Luke wrote down a more orderly, detailed gospel and it’s written to Gentiles. Some argue that Luke was a gentile. Marty, however, argues that Luke was a proselyte that converted to Judaism and once someone converts to Judaism, they are considered to be as Jewish as someone who was born Jewish. As a doctor, he was likely an Ascelapian priest. 
  - A reason we think he wrote to gentiles is because he wrote to Theophilus. Theophilus means “friend of God”. This could be a proselyte, moreover, it could be a euphemism for anyone reading Luke’s account who considers themself to be a friend of God.
- An Ordered Gospel
  - To Marty, it made sense to step away from the idea that Luke was a gentile writing a more detailed account of Jesus to other gentiles until stepping back and harmonizing with the other synoptic gospels. Luke ends up NOT being the most chronological or orderly.
  - There is another, less widespread, theory put out by M.D. Goulder from Harvard that Marty finds himself really liking his theory on Luke.
  - Goulder argues that Luke traveled to meet with all of the chazzanim, who were responsible for knowing the Text even if it wasn’t in front of them, and as a result, decided to write an ORDERED account, according to the Greek, not orderly, which he believes was intended to follow the weekly torah portion to be read each week in synagogue.
  - Marty doesn’t always think that Goulder got every section to line up perfectly but he has found that it mostly lines up brilliantly.
- Jewish Themes
  - Luke has very Jewish themes.
  - Luke argues that Jesus was a second Moses.
  - Luke is full of chiasms and parallelisms and other jewish literary devices.
  - Luke’s ability to align his gospel with the pre-existing parsha reading schedule AND work in all of the literary devices that Kenneth Bailey writes about in his two books _Poet & Peasant_ and _Through Peasant Eyes_ is remarkable and creates an incredible amount of depth.
  - Both ideas gives credence to the theory that Luke is writing to a Jewish audience rather than a gentile one.
- Timing
  - Marty believes Luke would have been written last.
  - Mark, Matthew, John, and finally Luke. 
  - With Luke being written last, Marty wonders about its authorship but nonetheless.

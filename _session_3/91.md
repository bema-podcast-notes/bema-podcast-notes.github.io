- David Stern: A messianic Jewish Teach in Jerusalem. Wrote the CJB translation and the Jewish New Testament Commentary.
  - I believe this is the translation the Marty uses for his daily writing discipline.
  - Stern prefers some specific terms in lieu of traditional ones like Immerser instead of Baptizer.
  - Stern also has some views that Marty disagrees with. For instance, he believes that Jewish people become apostates the moment they are baptized. This is part of the reason why he chooses Immerser in his translation.
- Matt 3:1-19
  - Isaiah 40 is quoted in Matt. 3. This is also mentioned in the episode about the Essenes.
    - We know that John the Baptist’s (JTB) father is a Righteous priest.
    - We cannot say that Zechariah was an essene but we can be certain that he doesn’t align with the Temple Priesthood.
    - However, parents could dedicate their children to the priesthood. In lieu of the temple priesthood, he could have sent JTB to the Essenes for this training.
    - JTB baptizes Jesus in the Jordan less than three miles away from the Qumran.
    - You are FEELING ESSENE while reading about JTB by mentioning Isaiah.
  - Why is JTB wearing camel’s hair and a leather belt?
    - Camel’s hair would have been worn with the hair facing the skin and would have felt like a brillo pad. Not a typical clothing choice.
    - Why? It’s in the Text. 
    - Elijah wore camel’s hair and a leather belt as well. 2 Kings 1:5-8 “…They replied, “He had a garment of hair[fn] and had a leather belt around his waist.” The king said, “That was Elijah the Tishbite.”
    - Elijah was all about the fire. He always wore the camel’s hair facing the skin so the is always reminded of how irritated God is with his people.
    - JTB is wearing his Elijah costume. “I am Elijah.” Matthew, the Jew, writing to his audience, the Jews, would have immediately picked this up. No need to preach a 3-point sermon about who he is.
    - Why wear the costume? Because his message aligns with Elijah’s. Elijah was zealous, passionate, will show everyone that his God is the real God.
      - Also, there was a lesson that God was trying to teach Elijah. That there is a place for zeal but it’s not what changes hearts.
    - Some students of the text have pointed out that JTB was performing Mikvah for people who were not allowed to perform Mikvah at the temple.
- Types of baptism.
  - Two types: Pharisee and Essene
  - JTB wasn’t doing a Christian baptism (Jesus wasn’t around yet). Instead he was doing a Jewish baptism. This is Mikvah.
  - Pharisee Baptism
    - We would have seen this in Synagogue.
    - Marty’s kosher deli story about mikvah in the back.
    - Jesus was chastised for not performing ritual hand washing before eating. This is about spiritual cleansing and not a physical cleansing.
    - Jesus critiqued Pharisaical cleansing all of the time. He did not condemn it though. Jesus likely performed it all of the time.
    - Marty performs a daily mikvah in the shower.
    - This is a daily prayerful liturgical activity rather than one of repentance.
  - Essene Baptism
    - This is a baptism of repentance. That is t’shuvah (which was our word for Zepheniah).
    - The Essenes said, when you baptize, it is not just a ritual washing you do before you eat. It is a washing of repentance.
    - When you decide that you have been walking in sin and error and instead you want to walk in the light, you repent. Once you have repented, and not before, you tell EVERYONE THAT IS WATCHING, I have decided publicly that I have been in error and I’m going to start walking accurately. That is a baptism of repentance.
    - One would immerse themselves. Being baptized by another is a Christian detail. Baptized by JTB would have meant by his authority, not necessarily by JTB.
- JTB’s three places of baptism: These 
  - Bethany beyond the Jordan where Elijah was fed by the Ravens
  - Aenon beyond the Shaleme where Elijah…
  - Judean Wilderness where Elijah…
  - JTB’s message is “you are in sin and you need to repent” just like Elijah.
- Examples of Repentance?
  - What should I do? If you have two cloaks, give one away. If you have plenty, share it.
  - Even though we say JTB was Essene like, this is where he departs from the Essene worldview. He chooses to meet the people and take the path to them rather than waiting for the path to come to him.
- Essene mikvah while copying the text
  - Essene scribes would pause and mikvah before writing the name of Adonai (yud hey vav hey).
- JTB calls the Pharisees and the Sadducees a brood of vipers.
  - He tells them to produce fruit that represents repentance. PROVE that you’ve repented before you take on this baptism.
  - JTB is inviting the people of God, not the Pharisees and Sadducees. This is partly why some believe JTB was performing mikvah for those who weren’t allowed to do so at the temple. The Sadducees and Pharisees had created their own temple purity system and JTB rejected that.
  - John uses a metaphor about an ax being at the root of the tree and dead trees not producing fruit would be thrown into the fire. Matthew also mentions “the winnowing fork is in his hand… he stands at his threshing floor…” The temple was built on the threshing floor.
    - Which gospel makes this mention?
  - Why does JTB use this imagery? This is JTB throwing down fire on the priesthood. Calling down God’s judgment on them.
  - JTB makes references to holy spirit and fire (another gospel with water and fire).
    - The first reference to major water is the flood which was a reference to judgment.
    - Baptism with fire would reference Sodom and Gomorrah.
    - Water and Fire would make reference to the plagues and Exodus.
- Does JTB have a correct assessment of the situation?
  - JTB is calling people out, rebuking, bringing judgment… but does he have all of his theology right? Is the bible asking us to consider this question?
  - Did JTB learn Elijah’s lesson?
  - How does a later conversation between Jesus and JTB allude to the answer to this question?
  - Marty argues that JTB is the rabbi of Jesus and that somewhere along the way, Jesus will step out of the way and tell JTB that he has his theology wrong.
- How could John have been Jesus' Rabbi?
  - Jesus wouldn't have followed the typical educational model
  - Jesus was a mumzer. He would not have been allowed to attend Beit Sefer, Beit Talmud/Midrash.
  - His family would have likely trained him.
  - Is it typical for a rabbi to be six months older than a disciple? No. Jesus wasn't typical though.
  - Every interaction Jesus has with John would be an interaction a person would expect a disciple to have with his Rabbi.

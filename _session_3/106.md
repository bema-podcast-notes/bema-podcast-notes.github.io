- Matthew 11:20-24
  - Jesus rebukes the three towns in the Triangle and points out their lack of repentence.
  - These towns are some of the most believing areas in all of Jerusalem.
  - Why would he specifically call them out for repentence?
  - Jesus also compares them to Tyre and Sidon and Sidom. This comparison likely gives insight into why towns with such incredible belief would need to repent.
  - References to Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom:
    - [Tyre References](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Tyre&resultspp=500&version=NIV)
    - [Sidon References](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Sidon&resultspp=500&version=NIV)
    - [Sodom References](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=Sodom&resultspp=500&version=NIV)
  - Remezes that seem to hold significance:
    - Tyre & Sidon: [Ezekiel 28:11-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2028:11-19&version=NIV)
      - Note: All of Ezekiel 28 is about Tyre and Sidon.
    - Sodom: [Ezekiel 16:49-52](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2016:49-52&version=NIV)
  - What was the sin of Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom? Not taking care of those in need. The mumzer. 
  - Jesus argues that if Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom were to have seen the signs performed by Jesus, they would have repented of their sins. The implication is that Bethsaida, Chorazin, and Capernaum didn't take care of those in need. While they believed deeply and followed all of the rules, it didn't make a difference in the way they treated others, specifically those who were in need like the alien, the orphan, and the widow.
- Matthew 11:25-30
  - Jesus says many things in this passage.
  - Focusing on the last parts of what Jesus says, though.
    > 28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
    - He mentions his yoke. Pharisees have a yoke and their yoke loads many expectations onto those who accept a yoke as their own.
  - Matthew 11:28 "and I will give you rest."
    - Remezes that seem to hold significance: Exodus 33:14.
    > The Lord replied, “My presence will go with you and I will give you rest.”
    - Those in the Triangle knew their scripture well.
    - Some expect that those hearing Jesus would have either picked up a stone to stone him or you could have heard a pin drop.
    - Jesus would have been expected to say, "God has said I will give you rest" or "God will give you rest" but certainly not, "I will give you rest."
    - **Jesus here claims to be God by claiming to provide rest that only God can provide.**
  - Matthew 11:29 "I am gentle and humble in heart, ..."
    - Remezes that seem to hold significance: Numbers 12:3
    > 3 (Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.)
    - **Jesus here claims to be Moses by claiming to be humble just as Moses was humble.**
  - Matthew 11:29 "... and you will find rest for your souls."
    - Remezes that seem to hold significance: Jeremiah 6:16
    > 16 This is what the Lord says:  
    > “Stand at the crossroads and look;  
    >     ask for the ancient paths,  
    > ask where the good way is, and walk in it,  
    >     and **you will find rest for your souls**.  
    >     But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’  
    - **Jesus here claims to be Torah, the way, by claiming to give others rest just has Jeremiah argues Torah gives rest.**

**Discussion Questions**

- Overview
  - Arrogance, haughtiness, I-know-better has gotten in the way and prevented the triangle from taking care of others.
  - Keep discussion light. It shouldn't be heavy-handed or dark.
- Head
  - Discuss passages and Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom. Do these passages sound like the church in your context?
- Heart and Hands
  - Am I the kind of person who is compassionate and loving and gracious and forgiving? Is this who I am?
  - Am I overly religious but lack the character of God?
  - Am I overly religious but lack godliness as God defines it?
  - Not
    - Do I go to church?
    - Do I follow all of the ten commandments?
    - Do I do my bible study.

- Review (Genesis 1-Gospels)
  - What does everyone think about the following statements?
    - **Marty**: Rabbi Jesus. I know we might dress it up a little bit. We don’t want to be flippant in our Jesus, but it should just be about Jesus. We should see nothing but Jesus. All the setup was to get us to Jesus. All of our study is to get us to Jesus. Understanding the scriptures is to get us to Jesus. Notice I’m not saying all the scriptures point towards Jesus, because that’s not the point. Jesus is the scriptures. The scriptures don’t point to Jesus. Jesus is the scriptures.
    - **Brent**: I have in my notes from a past BEMA session, or rather a BEMA cycle.
    - **Marty**: Call me back.
    - **Brent**: You said “the story in flesh.
- Reviewing Mumzer
  - Outcast
  - All of Galilee and Judea come to listen to Jesus
- Jesus comes off the mountain from teaching the sermon on the Mount
  - A Jewish Rabbi would immediately put his teaching into practice after something like the sermon on the Mount. We should look for clues in what comes next. 
- Touching the leper 
  - Leprosy included all kinds of skin conditions like acne, psoriasis, true leprosy, etc. 
  - Levitical rules about clean and unclean
  - I’d being unclean sinful? No, it was something to be expected
  - Does Jesus make the leper clean physically or ceremonially?
  - Is Jesus made unclean?
  - The Bible Project: [What the idea of holiness means in the Bible](https://youtu.be/l9vn5UvsHvM?si=-eAHcnDtuF97EO_D)
  - Clues that Jesus was made unclean
    - Six days later before Jesus goes into the Temple. 
    - Following the laws in Leviticus
    - Does Jesus wait 6 days because he’s unclean or because he’s setting an example, to fulfill the text, and to keep from being offensive?
  - Clues that the Leper was ceremonially unclean even after being touched by Jesus
    - “Go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded as a testimony to them.”
    - Following the laws in Leviticus. 
  - Town of Bethany
    - Could have been a leper colony
    - May mean House of Misery
    - Mary, Martha, and Lazarus lived in Bethany. 
- Meeting the Centurion in Capernaum. 
  - Eremos Topos to Capernaum is about a 20 min walk
  - The centurion is the second UNCLEAN person in a row that Jesus interacts with. 
  - This is what the kingdom should be like. Those you don’t think are in the kingdom are in and those you do think are in the kingdom are not.
  - A heavy mumzer agenda.
    - I have not found anyone in Israel with such greater faith than this.
    - Many will come from the east and the west.
      - East and West is gentile talk.
- Peter’s house
  - Jesus touches Peter’s mom and she’s immediately healed. 
  - Fulfillment of Isaiah 53 in how Jesus lived and not in his death. 
  - Capernaum is 30 mins from the Sermon on the Mount.
  - Marty argues that Jesus would have waited in the wilderness for 6 days before 
- Jesus gives orders to cross to the other side of the lake: _Another disciple said to Him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father,” but Jesus told him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”_
  - Discipleship: Marty’s example of true discipleship and the shortcut discipleship that doesn’t really count.
- Another disciple asking to bury his dead father first.
  - Jesus says let the dead bury their own dead.

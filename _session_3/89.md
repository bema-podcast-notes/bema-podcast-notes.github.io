- The disaster that her conception would have been for Mary. 
  - Joseph was trying to save face for Mary. 
- The prophecy from Isaiah
  - Is this about Jesus or is Luke alluding to something else?
- Men Askaenos
  - Temple worship of the zodiac. 
  - The wobble of the earth’s poles meant that the sun began to rise in a different “house of the zodiac” than years past. 
- Mithra
  - Wiseman/Magi from the East (from Babylon). 
  - They mentioned a “rising” star as in a star rising in a new “house”. 
  - Ballam prophesied that a star would rise from Israel. These Magi knew Ballam’s prophecy and they found themselves looking for a new king to be born in Bethlehem. 
  - The star stopped over the “house”. This could be read as the zodiac or as though they are in the Christmas story. 
- Mark’s gospel discussing the “tearing of the heavens”. 
  - Romans wouldn’t know about any veil of the temple except for the temple covering the front of the temple. 
  - Josephus tells us that this specific veil was covered in stars (or the zodiac to Roman’s). 
  - Roman’s, who were Mithra followers would have seen the zodiac being ripped apart implying that there was a new king and that Mithra was not it.

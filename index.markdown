<h1>Hi!</h1>

My name is Adam and I'm listening to the [BEMA Podcast](https://www.bemadiscipleship.com/) by [Marty Solomon](https://www.bemadiscipleship.com/hosts/marty) and co-hosted by [Brent Billings](https://www.bemadiscipleship.com/hosts/brent).  

As I listen through the podcast, I'm taking notes. These are my notes of the content presented on the podcast and are not intended to imply the beliefs of Marty or Brent.  

I reserve the right to be incorrect.

## My Notes

I have binged this podcast and did not take the time to take notes along the way. As I go back through the podcast, I'll take notes and publish them here.

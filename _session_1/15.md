### BEMA Episode 15: Into the Pit - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode begins an in-depth study of the life of Joseph, covering Genesis 37-40. The hosts examine the family dynamics, deception, and cycles of dysfunction within Jacob's household, while exploring themes of favoritism, practical wisdom, and God's presence in difficult circumstances.

#### Key Takeaways

- Joseph's story reveals ongoing family dysfunction stemming from unresolved conflicts between mothers (Rachel, Leah, Bilhah, Zilpah)
- The Hebrew word "nakar" (to scrutinize/recognize) appears throughout Genesis, highlighting cycles of deception within this family line
- Joseph displays narcissistic tendencies and lacks practical wisdom, yet God remains with him despite his character flaws
- The Judah and Tamar story (Genesis 38) parallels Joseph's story, showing themes of justice, recognition, and potential redemption
- God's favor doesn't guarantee an easy life - it often means finding hope and purpose in difficult circumstances

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Family Dysfunction and the Toldot Structure

The episode opens with "This is the account of Jacob's family line" (toldot), typically used to introduce someone's legacy. However, Jacob's legacy reveals deep family divisions where Joseph only associates with the sons of the concubines (Bilhah and Zilpah's children: Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher) rather than Leah's sons. This suggests the mothers' rivalry has transferred to the next generation, creating factions within the family.

##### The Bechor (Chosen One) Concept

Jacob's gift of an ornate robe to Joseph represents more than favoritism - it's a public declaration that Joseph is the "bechor" (chosen firstborn), despite not being chronologically first. The Hebrew describes this as a "coat of palms" - a long-sleeved undergarment unsuitable for manual labor, marking Joseph as destined for leadership rather than field work.

##### Joseph's Character Development

The hosts present Joseph as narcissistic and lacking practical wisdom, evidenced by:

- Bringing "evil, creeping, whispered rumors" about his brothers to Jacob (stronger language than simple tattling)
- Sharing prophetic dreams in ways designed to provoke his brothers
- Consistently focusing on self-promotion throughout his trials

##### The Nakar Pattern of Deception

The Hebrew word "nakar" (to scrutinize/recognize) creates a literary thread connecting multiple deception stories:

- Jacob deceiving Isaac (Genesis 27)
- Jacob and Laban's mutual deceptions
- Brothers deceiving Jacob with Joseph's bloodied coat (Genesis 37)
- Judah and Tamar's encounter (Genesis 38)

This pattern suggests cyclical family dysfunction rooted in deception.

##### Levirate Marriage (Yibbum)

The Judah-Tamar narrative introduces the concept of yibbum - a widow marrying her deceased husband's brother to preserve the first husband's legacy and provide community protection. This practice, found across many ancient cultures, emphasizes justice and community responsibility over individual desires.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Ancient Near Eastern Cultural Context

- Shechem as a major trade center with mercenaries and warlords, making it a dangerous location for Jacob's sons to pasture flocks
- The significance of palm tree names (Tamar) representing uprightness and righteousness in ancient Hebrew culture
- Egyptian depictions showing typical Canaanite clothing consisting of rectangular outer garments, making Joseph's long-sleeved undergarment distinctly non-working-class

##### Modern Parallels

- Family favoritism creating long-term dysfunction and sibling rivalry
- The temptation to use spiritual insights (like Joseph's dreams) for personal advantage rather than humble service
- Finding purpose and growth during unjust circumstances, as Joseph experienced in Potiphar's house and prison
- Breaking generational cycles of destructive behavior through conscious choice and divine intervention

##### Literary Techniques

The placement of the Judah-Tamar story within the Joseph narrative serves as a thematic counterpoint, showing how different characters respond to moral crisis. While Joseph tends toward self-promotion, Judah eventually acknowledges his wrongs and declares Tamar "more righteous than I."

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Historical and Archaeological Studies

- Research the role of Shechem in ancient Canaanite politics and trade networks
- Examine evidence for levirate marriage practices across ancient Near Eastern cultures
- Study Egyptian records of Semitic peoples in positions of household management

##### Theological Development

- Trace the evolution of the "chosen one" concept from Genesis through the broader biblical narrative
- Analyze how God's presence manifests during periods of suffering and injustice
- Explore the relationship between divine sovereignty and human character development

##### Literary Analysis

- Map all occurrences of "nakar" throughout Genesis to understand the complete pattern of recognition and deception
- Compare Joseph's character arc with other biblical figures who undergo similar trials
- Examine the narrative function of seemingly disconnected stories within larger biblical sequences

##### Psychological and Social Dynamics

- Study the long-term effects of polygamous family structures on child development in ancient contexts
- Analyze patterns of narcissistic behavior and their impact on family and community relationships
- Research the role of dreams and their interpretation in ancient Near Eastern cultures

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Family Dynamics**: How do the unresolved conflicts between Jacob's wives (Rachel, Leah, Bilhah, and Zilpah) manifest in the next generation, and what does Joseph's association only with certain brothers reveal about the family structure?

2. **Character Analysis**: What specific evidence does the episode present for Joseph displaying narcissistic tendencies, and how does this contrast with traditional Sunday school portrayals of him as purely virtuous?

3. **Literary Connections**: Explain the significance of the Hebrew word "nakar" and how it connects the Joseph story with the Judah-Tamar narrative. What larger themes does this word highlight throughout Genesis?

4. **Cultural Context**: How does understanding the concept of levirate marriage (yibbum) help us better interpret Judah's actions and Tamar's response in Genesis 38? What does this reveal about ancient concepts of justice and family responsibility?

5. **Theological Implications**: What does the statement "The Lord was with Joseph" mean in practical terms, given that Joseph ends up falsely accused and imprisoned? How does this challenge modern expectations about divine favor?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

Episode 15 challenges comfortable assumptions about biblical heroes by presenting Joseph as a complex, flawed character whose narcissistic tendencies mirror his father Jacob's deceptive nature. The episode reveals how family dysfunction cascades through generations when core issues remain unaddressed - in this case, the rivalry between Jacob's wives creating factions among their children.

The sophisticated literary structure connecting the Joseph and Judah-Tamar narratives through the word "nakar" demonstrates the intentional theological message about cycles of deception and the possibility of redemption. Rather than presenting simple moral lessons, these stories grapple with the reality that God works through deeply imperfect people and that divine favor doesn't eliminate suffering but provides meaning and hope within it.

The episode sets up a crucial question for the continuing narrative: Can generational cycles of dysfunction be broken, or does history simply repeat itself? This tension between cyclical despair and transformative hope forms the theological heart of the Joseph narrative, making it far more sophisticated than typical Sunday school treatments suggest.

### BEMA Episode 15: Into the Pit - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 15 - Into the Pit (2017)  
**Scripture:** Genesis 37-40  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon & Brent Billings  
**Focus:** The beginning of Joseph's story, examining his character flaws and the dysfunctional family dynamics that shaped the narrative of God's chosen family.

#### Key Takeaways

- Joseph appears arrogant and narcissistic rather than the traditional hero figure often portrayed in Sunday school stories
- The ornate robe represents Jacob's declaration of Joseph as his chosen heir (bechor), creating intense family hatred
- Joseph's dreams reveal his self-centered worldview and lack of wisdom in handling family relationships
- The story parallels earlier deception patterns in the family line through the Hebrew word "nakar" (recognize)
- Genesis 38 (Judah and Tamar) is deliberately placed to contrast with Joseph's story and show consequences of earlier actions
- God continues to work through flawed people despite their moral failures and character defects
- The family of God appears to be losing the plot of their mission to bless all nations

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Bechor (Firstborn) Principle

- The **bechor** receives a double portion of both responsibility and inheritance
- Jacob giving Joseph a second coat publicly declares him as the chosen heir
- This bypasses the natural birth order and creates family conflict
- Every son would have had a basic coat; the second coat was the significant statement

##### The Pattern of Deception (Nakar)

- **Nakar** (Hebrew: recognize/examine) appears 8 times in Genesis
- First two uses: Jacob deceiving others (Isaac and Laban)
- Next two uses: Jacob being deceived by his sons (Joseph's coat)
- Following two uses: Judah being deceived by Tamar
- The pattern shows deception being passed down through generations

##### Literary Structure and Parallel Stories

- Genesis 38 (Judah and Tamar) interrupts the Joseph narrative deliberately
- Both stories involve deception, recognition, and consequences
- The author juxtaposes stories to highlight themes of justice and moral failure
- Clothing items serve as evidence in both stories (Joseph's robe, Judah's seal and staff)

##### Joseph's Character Analysis

- **At age 17:** Brings bad reports about his brothers, shares arrogant dreams
- **With Potiphar:** His moral reasoning focuses on his own status and privileges
- **In prison:** Interprets dreams primarily to benefit himself
- Consistently displays self-absorption rather than selfless heroism

##### God's Mysterious Grace

- God blesses Joseph despite his character flaws
- Similar pattern seen with Jacob, Samson, and other flawed biblical figures
- Raises questions about what God sees in this family that others might miss
- Suggests God works through people's passion and "chutzpah" rather than perfection

#### Examples & Applications

##### Real-World Family Dynamics

- Favoritism in families creates lasting resentment and division
- Public displays of preference can destroy sibling relationships
- Young people often lack wisdom in handling sensitive situations
- Past family traumas and patterns tend to repeat across generations

##### Leadership and Character Development

- Early success can mask underlying character defects
- True leadership requires considering others' perspectives and feelings
- Moral reasoning that focuses primarily on self-interest reveals immaturity
- Growth often comes through difficult circumstances rather than comfort

##### Divine Grace and Human Failure

- God often works through imperfect people to accomplish His purposes
- Past failures don't disqualify someone from future usefulness
- Sometimes consequences must be experienced before transformation occurs
- God's timeline for character development may span generations

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Midrash and Jewish Commentary:** Traditional Jewish interpretations of Joseph's character and the family dynamics
- **Ancient Near Eastern Culture:** Understanding shepherding practices, inheritance laws, and prostitution in biblical times
- **Theological Questions:** How God's sovereignty works alongside human free will and moral failure
- **Literary Analysis:** Comparative study of parallel narratives and recurring themes throughout Genesis
- **Archaeological Context:** Historical background of Egypt during the Middle Kingdom period
- **Psychological Perspectives:** Family systems theory applied to biblical narratives
- **Hebrew Language Study:** Deeper exploration of key terms like nakar, bechor, and their cultural significance

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Character Analysis:** What specific evidence does the transcript provide that challenges the traditional "heroic Joseph" narrative, and how might this change our understanding of the story's message?

2. **Cultural Context:** How does understanding the bechor (firstborn) system help explain the brothers' violent reaction to Joseph's second coat, and what does this reveal about ancient inheritance practices?

3. **Literary Structure:** Why do you think the author of Genesis deliberately interrupts the Joseph story with the Judah and Tamar narrative in chapter 38, and what themes connect these two stories?

4. **Pattern Recognition:** Trace the use of the Hebrew word "nakar" (recognize) through the episodes mentioned. What does this pattern of deception reveal about the family's spiritual condition?

5. **Theological Reflection:** Given Joseph's apparent character flaws and the family's dysfunction, why might God continue to work through this particular family line, and what does this suggest about divine grace?

#### Brief Personal Summary

Episode 15 challenges comfortable assumptions about Joseph as a flawless hero, instead presenting him as an arrogant, self-centered young man whose actions contribute to family dysfunction. The episode reveals how Jacob's favoritism, demonstrated through the gift of a second coat, publicly declared Joseph as his chosen heir and triggered murderous hatred among the brothers.

The story becomes more complex when Genesis 38 interrupts the narrative to tell Judah's story with Tamar, creating a deliberate parallel that highlights themes of recognition and deception. Both stories feature clothing as evidence and use the Hebrew word "nakar" (recognize) at crucial moments, suggesting a pattern of deception passed down through generations.

Perhaps most significantly, the episode grapples with the troubling question of why God continues to bless and work through such flawed individuals. Rather than offering easy answers, it suggests that God may be drawn to passion and "chutzpah" rather than perfection, and that His purposes often unfold through broken people and dysfunctional circumstances. This sets up the ongoing question of whether this family can ever fulfill their calling to bless all nations, or if they have permanently lost the plot of their divine mission.

### Original Notes

- Genesis [37](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.37.NIV)-[40](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.40.NIV)
- Review
  - G-d invites us to trust the story
  - We've met Avraham, Isaac and Ishmael, Jacob and Esau.
  - Jacob has made the story weird.
  - We are now entering the story of Jacob's sons.
- [Genesis 37 - Joseph's Dreams](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.37.1-11.NIV)
  - Brent: Why doesn't the story list Leah's sons?
  - Joseph doesn't seem to have a lot of wisdom
  - V3: Israel loved Joseph more...
    - From Fohrman, this is not an issue of the colorfulness of the coat. This coat, literally striped coat, is a coat that all of the brothers would have been given by their father.
    - The issue is that Joseph got a SECOND coat. Israel is telling his sons that Rachel's sons are my favorite, Joseph was the first born and Benjamin the second, and Joseph is the behor and will receive a DOUBLE portion.
  - Joseph seems to take a pretty nacisistic, egocentric, cocky, unwise attitude toward his brothers.
    - Even Israel, who is overly protective of Joseph, is questioning his tact.
    - Joseph would be 17, his brother would be mid-20s.
    - Note: Ishamel was mocking his brother in the past and now the tables have turned, Joseph is now mocking his own brothers.
- [Genesis 37 - Joseph Sold by His Brothers](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.37.12-36.NIV)
  - First mention of Shechem: Gen 12 right after the blessing.
  - This family is a stench in the nostrils of the Shechemites.
  - They are not accomplishing the mission.
  - Why are the brothers grazing near the fields of Shechem? (Question from listener Brad).
    - These are the same brothers that circumcized the men of Shechem. Are they now in control of Shechem?
    - It seems like the author is pulling us back to "You're supposed to be in this world to bless all nations and is that working? Is that what Joseph is doing?"
    - Shechem will disappear for the rest of Genesis after this.
  - Reuben recommends throwing his brother into an empty cistern instead of killing him. (Reuben IS THE ACTUAL behor).
    - Judah recommends selling Joseph to the Midianites instead of killing him.
    - Why does Reuben leave? Judah steps up in his absence.
    - Now Reuben has to go back to his father and explain why something Reuben would have never approved us took place.
      - This might have created a rift in the family.
      - See the next story...
- [Genesis 38 - Judah and Tamar](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.38.NIV)
  - Judah leaves his family and he marries a Cananite woman. Possible proof of a rift?
    - Judah's granddaughter is named Tamar which means palmtree. The idea of the palmtree is that it is true and straight and righteous which is the meaning of Tamar.
      - Er was wicked and was destroyed by G-d as a result.
      - Judah ask's Onan to carry on his brother's family line but Onan spills his semen on the ground in order to keep from taking on this responsibility. G-d puts him to death as well.
      - Judah promises Shelah to Tamar but does not follow through. Tamar knows she's been slighted so she pretends to be a prostitute to sleep with Judah and become pregnant.
        - Judah gives Tamar his seal and its cord until he can pay her and she then leaves.
        - Judah is later told that Tamar has been a prostitute and has become pregnant.
          - He calls her out to have her burned to death.
          - Tamar reveals that the man she slept with owns the seal and its cord that he had given to her.
          - After realizing the situation, he admits she is more righteous (note what Tamar means, "righteous") that he is since he would not give her to Shelah.
        - Brent: Why is Judah with a prostitute? Did Judah's wife die?
        - This entire story is about Joseph and suddenly, we're reading a story about Judah as an older man. Why is 38 about Judah during a different time?
        - Compare Ch 37 and Ch 38.
          - `nakar` is the word for recognize.
          - nakar is used 8 times in Genesis.
          - When this word is used throughout Genesis, it's used to convict people of their sin.
            - When Judah hear's this word, recognize, it would have rung like a gunshot in his ears.
- [Genesis 39 - Jospeh and Potiphar's Wife](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.39.NIV)
  - Challenging the idea that Joseph was "a good person" and selfless.
    - Does Joseph refuse to sleep with Potiphar's wife because his character prevents him from doing so or because he's obsessed with his own success? Or is it because she was the only thing in the house that Potiphar had not given him?
  - Brent: What is it about all of the clothing that makes the difference here?
    - Fohrman's teaching on this is called "[Goats and Coats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCCedfePKUQ)"
  - Brent: Given how yucky this family can be, why does G-d continue to colocate with them?
    - G-d has perspective about this family we may not have as we read these stories. G-d keeps working in spite of their sin and brokenness.
  - Brent: "Potiphar paid attention to nothing except the food he ate. Is this why his wife pursues Joseph so much?"
- [Genesis 40 - The Cupbearer and the Baker](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.40.NIV)
  - Challenging the idea that Joseph was "a good person" and selfless.
    - Marty: Joseph to the Cupbearer: Remember me when you leave because I want to get out of here!
      - Personally, I can see this being fair... I can't see anyone behaving any differently in this situation.
- Nakar
  - Usages in Genesis
    - First two usages are about Jacob's deception
    - Next two usages are about Jacob BEING deceived
    - Next two usages are about Judah deceiving and then being decieved
    - Next two usages are about Joseph deceiving and then being decieved.
  - It feels like this story is spinning out of control. Will it find its way back?
  - If the book of Genesis is about trusting the story, how is the story going to get us back on track?

### BEMA Episode 7: The Preface - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Episode 7: The Preface (E7v24)**  
An analysis of Genesis 1-11 as the "preface" to God's narrative in Scripture, examining how eight key stories form a complex chiastic structure that invites readers to trust God's story and reframe their understanding of God, humanity, and creation.

#### Key Takeaways

- Genesis 1-11 functions as a "preface" to God's story, providing essential backstory and worldview framework
- Eight stories in Genesis 1-11 form a remarkable chiasm of chiasms (ABCD-ABCD structure)
- The center of this grand chiasm is Noah's name, meaning "comfort" and pointing to rest/Sabbath
- Each story contains problems, follows chiastic structure, and addresses themes of goodness vs. tragedy, stopping vs. obsession, rest vs. mistrust
- The preface invites readers to "Trust the Story" - trusting that creation is good, God loves creation, and there is enough
- God is consistently portrayed as loving and patient throughout these stories, not the angry Old Testament God of popular misconception
- The literary sophistication suggests divine inspiration beyond human capability alone

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Three-Part Structure of Scripture

**Preface (Genesis 1-11)**: High-level backstory, origin stories, meta-level conversations about God, humanity, and their relationships. Comparable to Tolkien's preface in Lord of the Rings that introduces Middle Earth's unique world.

**Introduction (Genesis 12-50)**: Introduction to Abraham and the family of God, setting up the main story with key characters and plot elements.

**Narrative (Exodus-Revelation)**: The main story of God's work - exodus, deliverance, and salvation.

##### The Eight Stories and Their Patterns

1. **Creation** (Genesis 1) - Goodness, God knowing when to stop, invitation to rest
2. **Adam and Eve** (Genesis 2-3) - Tragedy, obsession with moving forward, mistrust
3. **Cain and Abel** (Genesis 4) - Tragedy, obsession, mistrust
4. **Genealogy** (Genesis 5)
5. **The Flood** (Genesis 6-9a) - Goodness reaffirmed, God knowing when to stop destroying, rest
6. **Noah's Curse** (Genesis 9b-10) - Tragedy, obsession, mistrust
7. **Tower of Babel** (Genesis 11a) - Tragedy, obsession, mistrust
8. **Genealogy** (Genesis 11b)

##### Chiastic Structure (ABCD-ABCD)

- A stories (Creation, Flood): Focus on God's goodness, knowing when to stop, rest
- B stories (Adam/Eve, Noah's Curse): Tragedy, obsession, mistrust
- C stories (Cain/Abel, Tower of Babel): Tragedy, obsession, mistrust, themes of wandering vs. settling
- D stories (Genealogies): Connecting passages

##### The Central Message: "Trust the Story"

Located at the literal center of the grand chiasm is Genesis 5:28-29, where Noah's name (meaning "comfort") is revealed with the promise that "He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed." This points to the Sabbath principle and the call to trust rather than strive.

##### Theological Reframing

The preface challenges common assumptions about:

- **God's character**: Not an angry Old Testament God, but consistently loving and patient
- **Humanity's nature**: Not simply fallen, but invited into relationship and right response
- **Creation's status**: Fundamentally good, with enough provision
- **God's relationship to the world**: Active, caring, redemptive rather than distant or wrathful

#### Examples & Applications

##### Literary Parallel

Just as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings requires a preface to understand Middle Earth's unique rules and inhabitants (hobbits, elves, orcs), Genesis 1-11 provides the necessary worldview framework for understanding the rest of Scripture.

##### Teaching Moment

Marty's experience with student Paris Shewey demonstrates the power of discovery-based learning. When Paris observed that all the individual chiasms together formed a larger chiasm, it led to a breakthrough moment that revealed the sophisticated literary structure of the text.

##### God's Patience with Cain

Rather than immediate judgment, God sits with Cain, pleads with him, and explains that his position toward Cain hasn't changed despite the rejected sacrifice. This exemplifies the loving character revealed throughout the preface.

##### The Flood as Salvation

While surface reading suggests God's wrath in destroying the world, deeper analysis reveals God's love in saving the world and knowing when to stop destroying - paralleling the creation account where God knew when to stop creating.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Chiastic Analysis Practice

- Examine the chiastic structures in Cain/Abel and Noah's curse stories that weren't fully explored in the episode
- Compare the parallel themes between Tower of Babel and Cain/Abel (wandering vs. settling)
- Analyze how genealogies function as connecting tissue in the larger structure

##### Theological Implications

- Explore how this reframing of Genesis 1-11 impacts understanding of human nature and original sin
- Investigate the Sabbath theology embedded throughout these narratives
- Study how "trusting the story" applies to contemporary faith and practice

##### Literary and Hermeneutical Study

- Research other examples of chiasm of chiasms in ancient literature
- Examine how recognizing literary structures affects biblical interpretation
- Explore the relationship between form and meaning in Hebrew narrative

##### Cross-Biblical Connections

- Trace how themes from the preface (rest, trust, God's character) develop throughout Scripture
- Study how Jesus and New Testament authors reference and fulfill preface themes
- Analyze how the preface connects to the ultimate resolution in Revelation

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Structural Understanding**: How do the eight stories of Genesis 1-11 form a chiasm of chiasms, and what is the significance of Noah's name appearing at the center of this structure?

2. **Thematic Analysis**: Compare and contrast the "A stories" (Creation, Flood) with the "B and C stories" (Adam/Eve, Cain/Abel, Noah's Curse, Tower of Babel) in terms of their themes of goodness vs. tragedy, stopping vs. obsession, and rest vs. mistrust.

3. **Theological Reframing**: How does viewing Genesis 1-11 as a "preface" challenge common assumptions about God's character, particularly the idea of an "angry Old Testament God"?

4. **Application**: What does it mean to "Trust the Story" in practical terms, and how does this central message of Genesis 1-11 apply to contemporary faith and living?

5. **Literary Sophistication**: What does the complex chiastic structure of Genesis 1-11 suggest about the nature of biblical inspiration and the relationship between human authorship and divine guidance?

#### Personal Summary

Genesis 1-11 emerges not as a collection of ancient myths or moral tales, but as a sophisticated literary masterpiece designed to reframe our entire understanding of reality. Like a skilled author's preface, these eight interconnected stories work together to challenge our assumptions about God, humanity, and creation itself. The discovery that these narratives form a complex chiasm of chiasms, with Noah's name - meaning "comfort" - at the very center, reveals an invitation that transcends time: to trust that God's story is good, that creation has enough, and that rest rather than striving is the path to true flourishing.

This preface doesn't simply tell us what happened "in the beginning," but invites us to see differently - to recognize a God who is consistently loving rather than wrathful, who sits with us in our struggles rather than condemning from a distance, and who calls us into the Sabbath rhythm of trust rather than the exhausting cycle of human effort. The literary brilliance of this structure, emerging through student discovery rather than scholarly analysis, reminds us that Scripture continues to reveal new depths to those who approach it with curiosity and openness. As we move forward in the biblical narrative, we carry with us this foundational invitation to trust the story - not just intellectually, but as a way of life that acknowledges God's fundamental goodness and provision in our world.

### BEMA Episode 7: The Preface - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Episode 7: The Preface (2016)** - An analytical overview of Genesis 1-11, examining how these chapters function as a "preface" to the larger biblical narrative. The episode explores the literary structure, patterns, and theological themes that prepare readers for understanding the rest of Scripture through a Hebrew worldview.

#### Key Takeaways

- Genesis 1-11 serves as a "preface" to the main biblical narrative (Exodus through Revelation)
- The authors deliberately subvert familiar ancient Near Eastern stories to reframe understanding of God, creation, and humanity
- All eight sections of Genesis 1-11 form a larger chiastic structure with Noah at the center
- The preface establishes a fundamental choice between trust/rest versus obsession/mistrust
- Understanding this structure is essential for properly interpreting the rest of Scripture
- The brilliant literary design suggests divine inspiration working through multiple human authors

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### **The Three-Part Biblical Structure**

- **Preface**: Genesis 1-11 (world-building and concept introduction)
- **Introduction**: Genesis 12-50 (character introduction and plot setup)
- **Main Narrative**: Exodus through Revelation (the primary story of God's people)

##### **Genre Transformation in Genesis 1-11**

The authors take familiar ancient stories and deliberately subvert them:

- **Creation myths** become accounts of a good God creating good creation
- **Flood narratives** become stories of divine partnership rather than arbitrary destruction
- **Tower stories** become warnings about human hubris and self-reliance
- This subversion invites readers to "reframe what you think about the world"

##### **The Eight-Section Chiastic Structure**

1. **Genesis 1** (Creation) ↔ **Genesis 6-9a** (Noah's Ark)
2. **Genesis 2-3** (Adam & Eve) ↔ **Genesis 9b-10** (Noah's Curse)
3. **Genesis 4** (Cain & Abel) ↔ **Genesis 11a** (Tower of Babel)
4. **Genesis 5** (Genealogy) ↔ **Genesis 11b** (Genealogy)

##### **The Central Message: Noah as "He Rests"**

- The chiasm's center: Genesis 5:28-29, introducing Noah whose name means "he rests"
- Noah represents the solution to humanity's fundamental problem
- He embodies the principle of knowing when to stop and trusting God's story
- He becomes God's partner in saving creation

##### **Two Contrasting Patterns**

**Pattern of Trust** (Stories 1 & 5):

- Problems lead to deeper understanding
- Chiastic literary structure
- Good creation affirmed
- God knows when to stop (creating/destroying)
- Leads to rest and peace

**Pattern of Mistrust** (Stories 2, 3, 6, 7):

- Problems lead to deeper understanding
- Chiastic literary structure  
- Tragedy ensues
- Obsession replaces wisdom (with creativity, acquisition, destruction, fame)
- Leads to mistrust and brokenness

#### Examples & Applications

##### **Real-World Parallels to Biblical Obsessions**

- **Obsession with creativity** (Adam & Eve): Modern consumer culture's constant desire for more
- **Obsession with acquisition** (Cain & Abel): Competitive materialism and career rivalry
- **Obsession with destruction** (Noah's curse): Revenge cycles and inability to forgive
- **Obsession with fame** (Tower of Babel): Social media culture and self-promotion

##### **The Rest Principle in Practice**

- Learning when to stop working (Sabbath principle)
- Knowing when enough is enough in relationships, career, possessions
- Trusting God's timing rather than forcing outcomes
- Partnering with God rather than trying to control everything

##### **Literary Analysis Applications**

- Recognizing chiastic structures in other biblical texts
- Understanding how ancient authors used familiar stories to teach new truths
- Appreciating the sophisticated literary design of Scripture
- Reading with awareness of Hebrew thought patterns rather than purely Western approaches

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### **Advanced Literary Studies**

- Detailed analysis of each individual chiasm within Genesis 1-11
- Comparative study of Genesis accounts with other ancient Near Eastern texts
- Investigation of other large-scale chiastic structures in Scripture
- Examination of how this pattern continues through the rest of the biblical narrative

##### **Theological Implications**

- The doctrine of Scripture and multiple authorship under divine inspiration
- The relationship between divine sovereignty and human partnership (Noah model)
- The theology of rest and its implications for Christian living
- How the preface themes appear throughout the New Testament

##### **Practical Applications**

- Developing spiritual disciplines based on the rest principle
- Learning to identify and break cycles of obsession in personal life
- Building trust in God's goodness when facing life's tragedies
- Understanding how to be God's partner in restoration rather than trying to control outcomes

##### **Historical Context**

- The original audience's familiarity with ancient Near Eastern stories
- How these stories functioned in ancient Hebrew education and worship
- The development of Hebrew theological thought in contrast to surrounding cultures
- Archaeological findings that illuminate the cultural background of these narratives

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Structural Analysis**: How does the chiastic structure of Genesis 1-11 support the theological message about trust versus obsession? What would be lost if these stories were arranged differently?

2. **Literary Technique**: In what ways do the Genesis authors "subvert" familiar ancient stories, and why is this technique more effective than simply creating entirely new narratives?

3. **Character Development**: Compare and contrast the responses of Noah versus other characters (Adam/Eve, Cain, the Tower builders) when faced with challenges. What makes Noah's response exemplary?

4. **Thematic Integration**: How does the concept of "knowing when to stop" apply differently in the creation account (Genesis 1) versus the flood account (Genesis 6-9)? What does this reveal about God's character?

5. **Contemporary Application**: Given that Genesis 1-11 is designed to "reframe your understanding of reality," what aspects of modern worldview might need reframing in light of these ancient truths?

#### Personal Summary

BEMA Episode 7 reveals Genesis 1-11 as a masterfully crafted preface that prepares readers for the entire biblical narrative. Rather than viewing these as disconnected ancient stories, we discover a sophisticated literary structure that systematically addresses humanity's fundamental choice between trust and obsession. The eight sections form a chiasm centered on Noah, whose very name ("he rests") embodies the solution to human brokenness.

The episode demonstrates how ancient Hebrew authors took familiar cultural stories and deliberately subverted them to teach revolutionary truths about God's character and humanity's purpose. This isn't merely academic literary analysis—it's a call to examine our own lives for patterns of obsession that lead to mistrust and tragedy, while learning to embrace the rest that comes from partnering with God rather than trying to control our circumstances.

The brilliant design of this structure, especially if created by multiple authors, points to divine inspiration working through human creativity. As we prepare to move into the stories of Abraham and beyond, this preface has established the fundamental framework: will we trust God's good story and learn when to say "enough," or will we become obsessed with our own agendas and pull creation further apart? The choice that echoes throughout Scripture begins here, in these first eleven chapters that serve as the foundation for everything that follows.

    - The center of this chaiasm: Gen 5: 28-29: When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son. He named him Noah and said, “He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the grounds the LORD has cursed.”
      - The center of the verse: Noah which means "he rests" who is a man sent to save creation.
- What do we learn from the preface?
  - The story is good; **TRUST THE STORY.**
  - The authors are serious about this message: G-d knows when to say enough and we can follow in his footsteps and we know what happens when we don't.
  - The scriptures are brilliant. Humans can't do this on their own.
    - Rob Bell, "It's almost as if people had help."
    - If there are multiple authors to this story, it's even more impressive.
    - G-d's fingerprints are all over this.
    - We are being invited to reframe our understanding of reality. This was true of the audience of Genesis when it was originally given and it's true of us as well.

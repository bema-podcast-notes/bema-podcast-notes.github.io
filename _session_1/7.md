- Genesis 1-11 "The Preface"
- Prefaces are normal as you enter a world that you're not yet used to.
  - Then these stories often have an introduction where where you're introduced to characters and plot. Gen 12-50.
  - In the English, but definitely in the Hebrew there is a shift in type of literature and language as you move from Gen 1-11 into Gen 12-50.
  - In the preface, the author invites you to see the world in a new way.
- What was the author attempting to accomplish in the preface

    - The center of this chaiasm: Gen 5: 28-29: When Lamech had lived 182 years, he had a son. He named him Noah and said, “He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the grounds the LORD has cursed.”
      - The center of the verse: Noah which means "he rests" who is a man sent to save creation.
- What do we learn from the preface?
  - The story is good; **TRUST THE STORY.**
  - The authors are serious about this message: G-d knows when to say enough and we can follow in his footsteps and we know what happens when we don't.
  - The scriptures are brilliant. Humans can't do this on their own.
    - Rob Bell, "It's almost as if people had help."
    - If there are multiple authors to this story, it's even more impressive.
    - G-d's fingerprints are all over this.
    - We are being invited to reframe our understanding of reality. This was true of the audience of Genesis when it was originally given and it's true of us as well.

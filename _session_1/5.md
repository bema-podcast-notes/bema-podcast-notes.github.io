title: "5: A Misplaced Curse"
episodeIndex: 6
---
- There are problems in this story.
  - The order of the sons are not listed consistently. Oldest is typically listed first.
  - Vinyard (principle of first mention) is mentioned and Noah has already learned how to make win.
  - What is the big deal with Noah being naked in his own tent?
  - There aren't a lot of people around, how does Noah figure out who does what when he comes out of the tent?
- Genesis 9:18-28.
  - It's odd that it mentions Ham being the father of Canaan.
  - Why does Ham tell his brothers when he sees his father's nakedness?
  - Why would Shem and Jepheth be so hesitant to see his father naked.
  - Why curse his grandchild Canaan when Ham sees his father naken?
    - Ham isn't even mentioned. Ham did something wrong, not Canaan.
  - How does Ham know that he has done something wrong?
- If the creation story continues, a garden with fruit should be next.
  - Noah plants a vinyard and tastes its fruit.
  - Then we have this weirdness about nakedness.
  - Then we have a covering of the nakedness.
  - Then we have a curse.
  - We continue to have these parallels to the creation story with Adam and Eve in the garden.
- Midrash is an ancient Jewish form of commentary on a particular passage in the Text.
  - Westerners will exegete the passage, be deductive and straight forward.
  - Easterners will lead you on a process of discovery. It will be an inductive process of discovery.
    - They will tell a story within the story that will help you find the same journey and discover the same thing the teacher has discovered from the passage.
- Midrash for this passage:
  - To see means to perceives or to completely understand it. To grok.
    - In this eastern world, this would have been perceived as castration or molestation. Some even teach that this means "to sleep with your mother." This is found in Dueteronomy. The auther connects the idea of looking upon your father's nakedness with sleeping with your mother. Ultimately what the author is doing is saying "to sleep with your mother is to molest your father."
  - We have to determine was it molestation or castration?
    - The midrash tells us that it was castration. It leaves us wondering why castration and not molestation. There must be something in the test to lead us to that understanding.
    - In Gen 2 and 3, the four rivers have an interest set of details.
    - Lineage is also imagined with a river. There were four rivers in Gen 2 and 3.
    - In the story of Noah, he has three sons and Noah is told to be fruitful and multiply.
      - Noah is expected to have a fourth son.
    - Why does Noah curse Canaan? Marty is convicted from teachings of Rabbi Fohrman that Noah is bent on revenge. Ham has robbed Noah of something, a fourth son, and now Noah is bent on robbing Ham of something from him.
  - In the first creation story, G-d knows when to say enough with his creative power. Adam and Eve also have to learn this lesson.
    - In this new creation story, G-d is learning when to say enough with his destructive power.
    - Noah now has to learn this same lesson.
      - Noah's invitation is to trust G-d and not let his vengence get the best of him.
        - Don't pass on Ham's mistake to his children and his children's children.
        - This word for curse is use only by G-d and one person in the text, Noah.
        - This curse is reserved for G-d alone.
        - Noah is stepping into the role of G-d. He takes this curse and throws it NOT on the one who deserves it but on the one who doesn't deserve it.
        - This decision will have eternal repercussions.
        - Brent notices that it's G-d who asks the question, "What have you done?" in Gen. 3. It's not directly in the text but it's a seemingly natural question we would expect Noah to ask as he comes out of the tent. This is more assumption though. However, an interesting parallel.
        - This is one of the places we are first introduced to forgiveness.
  - What we keep learning here is how to be like G-d.
    - When to stop creating.
    - When to stop destroying.
    - How to trust the story.
    - Who G-d is.
    - What man is afraid of.
    - The plea over and over again is to just trust the story.
    - Don't lash out in our insecurity and our shame.
      - This story is all pent up in Noah's shame.
      - Will Noah take it out on the next guy or is he going to know when to say enough and let the world continue down a redemptive path.
        - Unfortuneately, Noah makes the wrong decision and this story ends in yet another tragedy.

> **Chad**  
> @Josh Bossé @Melissa K so If I follow, this theory is that Ham castrates Noah as the next big step in world domination in the the new world order. Step 1 was making sure he would have the first male of the next generation, and step 2 was “removing” the competition? What a Ham! (edited)

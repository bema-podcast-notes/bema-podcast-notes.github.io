- [Genesis 11:27-32](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.11.27-32)
- The Jewish mind asks the question, "Why does G-d choose Avram?"
  - Western minds typically respond with it doesn't matter, he is who G-d chose.
  - However, there must be a reason. We actually meet Avram in the genealogies before his story begins.
- [Genesis 11:27-32](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.11.27-32)
  - Westerners think there is definitely no treasure buried in a genealogy.
    - But we will try to find the treasure
  - Problems:
    - Avram had the choice to marry someone who wasn't barren but did not
    - Avram is the firstborn and his responsibility is to carry on the line.
      - A barren wife prevents that from happening.
    - Women do NOT show up in genealogies UNLESS there is a good reason.
      - They are there for a reason.
      - Why is Milkah mentioned so many times?
      - Why is Milkah and Iskah mentioned at all?
        - Milkah shows up later in the story HOWEVER, Iskah does not and it makes little sense why should would be in the story.
      - Why talk about Sarai's barreness after talking about Milkah and Iskah? Why not mention that two verses sooner?
  - Jewish Midrash
    - There is a midrash that teaches Avram enters and leaves a furnace and when he leaves, he marries Iskah.
  - In a Chaldean tongue, Iskah means "princess". In the Hebrew, Sarai means "my princess".
    - Iskah and Sarai may be the same person.
    - When reading the Hebrew, the grammar is odd.
      - "Avram and Nahor, HE took wives" instead of "Abram and Nahor, THEY took wives".
      - We see something similar in the story of Noah's Nakedness,
        - "Shem and Japheth, he took a blanket and they walked backwards".
        - In the Hebrew mind, this means two of more people decide to do a benevolent act together and they are of one mind.
      - In the Hebrew mind, credit for the idea goes to the first person mentioned.
      - Abram is given credit for the idea to take the daughters of their deceaced brother as their wives out of benevolence and Nahor agrees.
        - Why? Their father has died and he is everything to his children. He provides, protects, gives dignity, etc. for his children.
        - Avram by every stretch of the imagination get the first choice and he chooses the oldest daughter of Haran who was known to be barren.
          - How would they know she was barren? The moment a girl mentrates in this culture, they are given away in marriage.
          - It is remarkable that there is a person who is more interested in someone else, who knows when to stop, and doesn't put himself first.
            - This when when G-d shows up. G-d says, I can work with this.
  - We are invited to be like Avram, to know when to say enough, and to put others first.

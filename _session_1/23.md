### BEMA Episode 23: Falling on Joyful Faces - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 23: Falling on Joyful Faces (E23v24)  
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 24-40 (Construction of the Tabernacle)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Topic:** The Tabernacle as a mobile reminder of Genesis Creation and God's presence that brings joy, not fear

This episode explores the detailed instructions for building the Tabernacle, revealing how it serves as a portable recreation of the Garden of Eden and God's original creation design, culminating in the profound truth that God's presence should inspire joyful worship rather than fearful cowering.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Tabernacle construction mirrors the Genesis creation account with seven divine speeches and Sabbath rest
- The golden calf incident sits strategically in the center of a chiasm between two sets of identical Tabernacle instructions
- The Tabernacle serves as a mobile Genesis 1-3, carrying the reminder of God's original creative intent through the wilderness
- The Tent of Meeting uses the Hebrew word "moed" - the same word from the center of the Genesis 1 chiasm
- The Ark of the Covenant contains the Law (Torah), often called the "Tree of Life," guarded by cherubim just like in Eden
- When the Tabernacle and Temple were dedicated, people fell face down with joy, not fear
- Believers today are the new temple, and should inspire joyful encounters with God's presence rather than fear

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Seven Divine Speeches Structure

The Tabernacle instructions contain seven instances where "The Lord said to Moses" appears (Exodus 25:1, 30:11, 30:17, 30:22, 31:1, 31:12), paralleling God's seven creative declarations in Genesis 1. The seventh speech specifically addresses Sabbath observance (Exodus 31:12-18), mirroring how God rested on the seventh day of creation.

##### The Chiastic Structure of Exodus 24-40

The narrative forms a chiasm (inverted parallel structure) with these elements:

- **A:** Glory of the Lord (Exodus 24)
- **B:** Tabernacle and priestly garments instructions (Exodus 25-30)  
- **C:** Bezalel, Aholiab, and materials; Sabbath (Exodus 31)
- **D:** CENTER - Golden calf and broken tablets (Exodus 32-34)
- **C':** Bezalel, Aholiab, and materials; Sabbath (Exodus 35)
- **B':** Tabernacle and priestly garments construction (Exodus 36-39)
- **A':** Glory of the Lord fills the Tabernacle (Exodus 40)

**Center of the chiasm:** Exodus 33:14 - "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."

##### The Tabernacle as Mobile Genesis

The Tabernacle recreates key elements from the Garden of Eden:

- **Tree of Life:** The Torah/Law stored in the Ark, traditionally called the "Tree of Life"
- **Cherubim guardians:** Embroidered on the Holy of Holies curtain, just as they guarded Eden's entrance
- **Divine presence:** God's glory dwelling among His people as in the original garden
- **Rest and meeting:** The "Tent of Meeting" (Hebrew: moed) connects to the appointed times and seasons from Genesis 1

##### Creation Language Parallels

The completion of the Tabernacle uses identical language to Genesis creation:

- **Genesis 2:2:** "God had finished the work... so on the seventh day He rested"
- **Exodus 40:33:** "Moses finished the work"
- **Genesis 2:3:** "God blessed the seventh day"
- **Exodus 39:43:** "Moses... blessed them"

##### The Temple Dedication Pattern

Both Tabernacle and Temple dedications followed the same joyful pattern:

1. **Fire from God's presence** consumes the sacrifices
2. **People fall face down** - but in joy, not terror  
3. **Worship and thanksgiving** declaring "His love endures forever"
4. **Recognition of God's goodness** rather than fearful cowering

This pattern extends to Pentecost, where **tongues of fire** rested on believers as the new living temples.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern House Decorating Analogy

Just as couples spend considerable time and attention choosing paint colors, fixtures, and furniture placement to create their ideal home, God provides extensive detail about the Tabernacle design because He delights in creating a beautiful dwelling place with His people.

##### The "Skeleton Practice"

Marty's discipline of memorizing biblical subtitles to understand Scripture's structure demonstrates how repetitive engagement with God's word reveals patterns and connections not immediately apparent in casual reading.

##### Contemporary Church Application

When people encounter believers today (as God's new temple), the response should mirror the ancient Temple dedications - people should "fall on joyful faces" because they experience God's love and goodness, not fear or judgment.

##### Ray Vander Laan's Challenge

The conviction that modern Christians should be known for inspiring joy in others through God's presence, rather than instilling fear or judgment, challenges contemporary church culture and individual Christian witness.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Detailed study of Tabernacle furniture and symbolism:** Each piece's connection to Creation themes and spiritual significance
- **The role of Bezalel and Aholiab:** God's gifting of artistic and craftsmanship abilities for sacred work  
- **Levitical priesthood and sacrificial system:** How the Tabernacle ceremonies point to broader theological truths
- **Chiastic structures throughout Scripture:** Identifying similar patterns in other biblical narratives
- **The Hebrew word "moed":** Its full range of meanings across festivals, appointments, and divine encounters
- **Sabbath theology:** The connection between Creation rest, Tabernacle completion, and Christian spiritual disciplines
- **Temple theology in the New Testament:** How Jesus and the Church fulfill Tabernacle/Temple imagery
- **The nature of God's presence:** Comparing manifestations from Eden through the Tabernacle to the indwelling Spirit

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How do the seven "Lord said to Moses" speeches in the Tabernacle instructions parallel the Genesis creation account, and what does this suggest about the nature of God's creative work?**

2. **What is the significance of the golden calf narrative being positioned at the center of the chiastic structure in Exodus 24-40, and how does this relate to the promise in Exodus 33:14?**

3. **Explain how the Tabernacle serves as a "mobile Genesis 1-3" and identify at least three specific connections between the Tabernacle design and the Garden of Eden.**

4. **Why is it significant that people "fell on joyful faces" rather than fearful faces during both the Tabernacle and Temple dedications, and what does this reveal about God's character?**

5. **According to the episode's conclusion, how should modern believers (as the new temple of God) impact others, and how might this challenge contemporary Christian culture?**

#### Personal Summary

This episode transforms the seemingly tedious Tabernacle construction narrative into a profound theological statement about God's desire to dwell among His people. The intricate parallels between the Tabernacle building and Genesis creation reveal that God is not simply giving architectural instructions, but recreating Eden in portable form.

The central message emerges through the chiastic structure: despite human failure (the golden calf), God's promise remains - "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest." The Tabernacle becomes a mobile reminder that God's presence brings joy, celebration, and rest rather than fear and condemnation.

Most convicting is the challenge that modern Christians, as living temples, should inspire the same joyful response that characterized ancient Temple dedications. People should encounter God's love and goodness through believers in ways that cause them to "fall on joyful faces" in worship rather than recoil in fear or judgment. This reframes Christian witness from fear-based evangelism to joy-filled demonstration of God's enduring love and character.

### BEMA Episode 23: Falling on Joyful Faces - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 23 - Falling on Joyful Faces (2017)  
**Scripture Coverage:** Exodus 24-40  
**Main Topic:** The construction of the tabernacle as God's mobile sanctuary and its deep connections to the Genesis creation account, establishing a place of rest and divine presence among His people.

#### Key Takeaways

- The tabernacle construction parallels Genesis creation with seven "And the Lord said" statements
- The tabernacle serves as a mobile Genesis 1 story, constantly reminding God's people of His rest and presence
- The center of the tabernacle chiasm focuses on God's promise: "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest" (Exodus 33:14)
- The grand opening of both the tabernacle and Solomon's temple resulted in people falling face down in joyful worship
- Modern believers are the new temple of God, called to be mobile reminders of God's goodness and love
- People should have the same joyful reaction when meeting God's temple today as they did in ancient times

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tabernacle as New Creation

The tabernacle construction deliberately echoes Genesis 1 creation:

- **Seven Divine Speeches:** Just as Genesis 1 contains seven "And God said" statements, the tabernacle instructions contain seven "And the Lord said to Moses" statements (Exodus 25:1, 30:11, 30:17, 30:22, 30:34, 31:1, 31:12)
- **Sabbath Connection:** The seventh divine speech addresses Sabbath observance, mirroring the seventh day of creation
- **Completion Language:** Both Genesis 2 and Exodus 39-40 use similar language about finishing work, blessing the work, and resting

##### The Tent of Moad (Meeting/Seasons)

The Hebrew word "moad" appears in both Genesis 1 (for seasons/appointed times) and as the designation for the Tabernacle as "Tent of Meeting":

- Represents the center of the Genesis 1 chiasm
- Creates a "mobile Genesis 1 story" traveling with God's people
- Establishes regular, appointed times for encountering God

##### Tabernacle Symbolism Connecting to Eden

- **Tree of Life:** The Torah (Law) in the Ark of the Covenant represents the Tree of Life
- **Cherubim:** Both guard the Tree of Life in Eden and appear embroidered on the tabernacle curtain
- **Holy of Holies:** Functions as a restored Eden where God's presence dwells behind the veil

##### Chiastic Structure of Tabernacle Construction

The tabernacle narrative forms an eight-part chiasm:

- A/A': Glory of the Lord (Chapters 24 & 40)
- B/B': Tabernacle and priestly garments instructions
- C/C': Bezalel and Oholiab (craftsmen)
- D/D': Sabbath instructions
- **Center:** Golden calf incident and God's promise of presence and rest (Exodus 33:14)

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Temple Openings

**Tabernacle Opening (Leviticus 9:23-24):**

- Fire came from God's presence
- Consumed burnt offerings
- People shouted for joy and fell face down in worship

**Solomon's Temple Opening (2 Chronicles 7:1-3):**

- Fire came down from heaven
- Glory of the Lord filled the temple
- People knelt face down, worshipped, and proclaimed "He is good; his love endures forever"

##### Modern Application - Believers as God's Temple

According to Acts, believers become the new temple through Pentecost:

- Fire from the old temple (tongues of fire) rested on the new temple (believers)
- Christians collectively form God's mobile temple
- Should provoke the same joyful response in others as ancient temples did
- Challenge: Do people fall down in joyful worship when they encounter God's people today?

##### Practical Implications for Christian Living

- Believers should be "mobile reminders of Genesis 1"
- Called to be "tents of moad" - appointed meeting places with God
- Should invite others to trust God's story through hospitality and love
- Need to examine whether our lives reflect God's goodness and inspire worship

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Detailed study of tabernacle furnishings and their symbolic meanings
- Comparison of priestly garments with Eden imagery
- Investigation of other Old Testament chiastic structures
- Analysis of Pentecost as the fulfillment of tabernacle theology
- Examination of how Jesus fulfilled tabernacle symbolism
- Study of hospitality patterns from Abraham through the tabernacle
- Exploration of Ray Vander Laan's "That the World May Know" series, particularly Volume 10

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Pattern Recognition:** What are the seven instances of "And the Lord said to Moses" in the tabernacle construction, and how do they parallel Genesis 1? What does the seventh instance specifically address?

2. **Symbolic Analysis:** Explain how the tabernacle serves as a "mobile Genesis 1 story." Include at least three specific connections between tabernacle elements and the Garden of Eden.

3. **Structural Understanding:** Describe the eight-part chiasm of the tabernacle construction. What is significant about the center of this literary structure, and how does it relate to the overall theme?

4. **Historical Comparison:** Compare and contrast the grand openings of the tabernacle (Leviticus 9) and Solomon's temple (2 Chronicles 7). What was the consistent human response, and why is this significant?

5. **Contemporary Application:** According to the episode, how should modern believers function as God's temple? What practical changes might be needed to ensure people have the proper response when encountering God's people today?

#### Personal Summary

BEMA Episode 23 reveals the tabernacle as far more than a detailed construction project - it represents God's masterful design to create a portable Eden that would constantly remind His people of His presence, rest, and goodness. The intricate parallels between tabernacle construction and Genesis creation demonstrate God's intentional callback to the perfect world He originally designed. The seven divine speeches, Sabbath emphasis, and completion language all point to the tabernacle as a new creation project.

The episode's most convicting insight comes from recognizing that believers today serve as God's mobile temple. Just as ancient people fell face down in joyful worship when encountering God's presence in the tabernacle and temple, modern encounters with God's people should provoke similar reactions of awe, joy, and proclamation that "the Lord is good; his love endures forever." This challenges contemporary Christians to examine whether their lives truly reflect the glory, rest, and hospitality that characterized God's dwelling places throughout Scripture. The tabernacle reminds us that wherever God's people go, they carry the potential to be a "tent of moad" - an appointed meeting place where others can encounter the living God and find the rest He offers to all who trust His story.

### Original Notes

- Exodus 24-40
- Review
  - Preface and Intro in Gen
    - Learn fundamentals about G-d and what it would look like for people to trust Him.
    - We learned about those that partners with G-d and their journeys.
  - G-d rescues this family from Egypt.
  - G-d then marries this people and enters into a relationship with him.
  - The entire rest of the book of Exodus ends up being about the Tabernacle.
- Exodus
  - Verses
    1. Exodus 25:1 "The LORD said to Moses,"
    2. Exodus 30:11 "Then the LORD said to Moses,"
    3. Exodus 30:17 "Then the LORD said to Moses,"
    4. Exodus 30:22 "Then the LORD said to Moses,"
    5. Exodus 30:34 "Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha and galbanum—and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts,"
    6. Exodus 31:1 "Then the LORD said to Moses,"
    7. Exodus 31:12 "Then the LORD said to Moses,"
  - These verses call us back to the Genesis story:
    - Looking at verses 12 and 13, in the seventh "Then the LORD said," G-d calls his people to follow the Sabbath, a call back to the creation story in Genesis 1.
    - In Genesis 2, at the end of the Genesis 1 story, G-d finishes his work and rests. Compare that to Exodus 40:33 "and so Moses finished the work." or Exodus 39 "the Israelites had done all of the work just as G-d had commanded Moses. Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the LORD commanded so Moses blessed them."
      - There are lots of parallels between these.
    - In the center of the Tabernacle was the Holy of Holies in which sat the Ark of the Covenant. Inside the Ark was the Tablets or the Law. The Torah was called the Tree of Life that sat behind the curtain on which was a depiction of Cherubim which protected the center of the Garden after the fall in Genesis.
    - The Tabernacle was also known as the Tent of Meeting.
      - The word for "meeting" was "moad" in Hebrew.
      - This is also the word for "seasons" that we learned in Genesis 1.
- Inverted Repetition in the skeletal structure of the Tabernacle portion of Exodus
  - The chiasm:
    - 1: Glory of the LORD (24:15–18)
      - 2: Tabernacle and priestly garments (25–30)
        - 3: Bezalel and Oholiab (31:1–11)
          - 4: Sabbath (31:12–18)
            - Center:
            > “The LORD replied, ‘My Presence will go with you and I will give you rest.’” Exodus 33:14
          - 5: Sabbath (35:1–3)
        - 6: Bezalel and Oholiab (35:30–35)
      - 7: Tabernacle and priestly garments (36–39)
    - 8: Glory of the LORD (40:34–38)
  - The center AGAIN reminds us about Genesis 1, a mobile reminder that in the center of your camp, where ever you go, where ever the Tabernacle is setup, it's a constant reminder to call you back to the love of G-d, to the forgiveness of G-d, the acceptance of G-d, and the rest that trusting the story provides you.
  - Huge grand opening in the beginning of Leviticus, fire comes from the Holy of Holies and consumes the offering. Everyone shouted for joy and fell on their faces.
  - In 2nd Chronicles 20, Solomon's temple is built and fire again came down and consumes the sacrifices, and people again fall face down worshiping the LORD again.
  - From RVL: "In Acts, on the day of Pentecost, G-d opened up a new temple, and fire came out of the old temple and it split apart into tongues of fire and it came to rest on the NEW temple and G-d opened up a new temple, and it's you and me, if that is how people reacted whenever they found the temple of G-d, if they fell on their face and shouted with joy and said "the LORD endures forever, then what in the world should people do when they meet you? The new temple of G-d."

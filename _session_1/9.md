### BEMA Episode 9: Letting Go - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode explores Genesis 12-14, focusing on Abraham's (Avram's) call from God, his journey to Canaan, the incident in Egypt, and the separation from Lot. The central theme examines how Abraham learns to trust God's story even after making significant mistakes, demonstrating that our failures don't have to define our future.

#### Key Takeaways

- God's call to Abraham required leaving everything familiar: his country, people, and father's household (beit av)
- Abraham's partnership with God is missional - he's blessed to be a blessing to all nations
- Even faithful people make mistakes and face the tension between trusting God and being responsible
- Abraham's deception in Egypt teaches that we cannot control circumstances as we think we can
- True faithfulness means doing the next right thing, even after failure
- Abraham demonstrates justice-oriented character by repeatedly putting others' needs before his own
- Mistakes don't have to define us if we learn from them and continue trusting God's story

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Radical Nature of God's Call (Lech-lecha)

In ancient Near Eastern culture, leaving one's father's household (beit av) was unprecedented and dishonoring. The beit av encompassed:

- Extended family living arrangements
- Business and livelihood
- Cultural narratives and worldview
- Religious beliefs and practices
- Social identity and belonging

Abraham's departure wasn't just geographical but represented a complete break from his entire social, cultural, and religious framework.

##### Hebrew Family Structure and Language

- **Beit av** (house of the father): The patriarchal household system where multiple generations lived together
- **Mishpucha**: Family in the broader sense
- Hebrew kinship terms are fluid: "sister" and "brother" can refer to various family relationships, not just direct siblings
- Vertical relationships: father, grandfather, great-grandfather (all "fathers")
- Horizontal relationships: sister, niece, cousin (all "sisters")

##### The Missional Nature of God's Covenant

God's blessing of Abraham isn't transactional but transformational. The promise "all peoples on earth will be blessed through you" establishes that Abraham's relationship with God serves a global redemptive purpose.

##### The Egypt Incident and Its Lessons

Abraham's plan in Egypt reveals several key insights:

- His half-truth about Sarah being his "sister" was technically accurate in Hebrew kinship terms
- The plan was economic - to receive gifts from suitors while avoiding murder
- Pharaoh's power disrupted normal courtship protocols
- The experience taught Abraham that human plans cannot control all circumstances

##### Trusting the Story vs. Controlling Circumstances

The narrative demonstrates the tension between:

- Being responsible stewards vs. trusting God completely
- Using human wisdom vs. waiting on divine provision
- The illusion of control vs. the reality of dependence on God

#### Examples & Applications

##### Ancient Hospitality and Marriage Customs

- Patriarchs arranged marriages for women in their households
- Suitors brought mohar (bride price/dowry) to the patriarch
- The process involved extended negotiation and gift-giving
- Pharaoh's direct taking of Sarah violated normal protocols

##### Geographic and Economic Realities

- The Nile Delta provided consistent fertility due to annual flooding
- Egypt served as the regional breadbasket during famines
- The area contained up to 100 feet of farmable topsoil (compared to 4-6 feet in other fertile regions)
- Going to Egypt during famine was standard practice, not necessarily unfaithful

##### Character Development Through Crisis

Abraham's story demonstrates how faithful people:

- Make imperfect decisions while trying to follow God
- Learn from mistakes without being defined by them
- Choose justice and generosity even when it's costly
- Trust God's promises even when circumstances seem impossible

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Historical and Archaeological Context

- Ancient Near Eastern marriage customs and legal frameworks
- Economic systems and trade routes in the Bronze Age
- The role of Egypt in regional politics and survival strategies
- Archaeological evidence for early Hebrew migration patterns

##### Theological Themes

- The relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility
- How God works through imperfect people to accomplish perfect purposes
- The nature of covenant promises and their fulfillment over time
- The concept of being "blessed to be a blessing" in modern contexts

##### Literary Analysis

- Chiastic structure in biblical narratives and their theological significance
- The use of repetitive elements to link related stories
- How Hebrew wordplay and kinship terminology create deeper meaning
- The role of geography in biblical storytelling

##### Contemporary Applications

- Decision-making when facing competing values (security vs. trust)
- Recovering from moral failures and poor choices
- Balancing planning with dependence on God
- Practicing justice in power differential situations

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Cultural Context**: What made God's call for Abraham to leave his father's household so radical in ancient Near Eastern culture, and how does this compare to modern expectations about family independence?

2. **Character Development**: How does Abraham's response to the separation conflict with Lot demonstrate his growth from the Egypt incident, and what principle does this teach about learning from mistakes?

3. **Theological Significance**: In what ways does Abraham's covenant with God establish a missional rather than purely transactional relationship, and how does this inform our understanding of divine blessing?

4. **Moral Complexity**: Analyze Abraham's deception in Egypt - what elements show both his moral failure and his attempt to be responsible, and what does this teach us about the complexity of faithful living?

5. **Literary Structure**: How does the chiastic structure of the Egypt narrative reinforce the central lesson about the limits of human control, and why is this literary technique significant for understanding the story's meaning?

#### Summary

Episode 9 reveals Abraham as a complex, relatable figure who embodies both faithful trust and human frailty. His journey from Haran to Canaan represents more than geographical movement - it's a radical departure from cultural security toward divine calling. The Egypt incident serves as a crucial learning experience, teaching that our best-laid plans cannot control all circumstances and that true faithfulness means trusting God's story even when we cannot see the outcome.

Most significantly, Abraham demonstrates that mistakes need not define us. After his deceptive scheme in Egypt backfires, he doesn't allow shame to derail his calling. Instead, he applies the lesson learned - that he cannot control circumstances - to his conflict with Lot. By giving Lot first choice of land and later returning him to the king of Sodom, Abraham repeatedly chooses justice and trust over self-interest and control.

This pattern of failure, learning, and renewed trust establishes Abraham as a model not of perfection but of resilience in faith. His story encourages us that God can work through our imperfections and that our next right choice matters more than our last wrong one. The episode ultimately shows us a God who partners with flawed humans not despite their mistakes but through their willingness to keep trusting the larger story He is writing.

### BEMA Episode 9: Letting Go - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 9: Letting Go (2016)  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 12-14  
**Topic:** The call of Abraham (Avraham) and his initial adventures in the land of Canaan, exploring themes of faith, trust, letting go, and learning from mistakes.

#### Key Takeaways

- Leaving one's father's household in ancient patriarchal culture meant abandoning everything: provision, trade, identity, family, and religious beliefs
- Abraham's calling was not just about personal blessing but about being a conduit for blessing all nations
- Abraham demonstrates the tension between faith and responsibility that all believers experience
- True faith involves building altars (permanent worship) while pitching tents (maintaining mobility and trust)
- Abraham's mistakes in Egypt teach him valuable lessons about trusting God's plan rather than his own schemes
- The principle of letting go - even of things we believe are essential to God's promises - demonstrates mature faith
- Abraham's character development shows how to learn from failures and apply those lessons positively

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Patriarchal Family Structure (Beit Av)

The Hebrew term "beit av" (house of my father) describes the ancient Eastern family structure where extended families lived under one patriarch's authority. This included:

- Multiple generations living together
- Shared trade and identity through the father
- Religious beliefs passed down through patriarchal authority
- Complete economic and social dependence on the family structure

##### The Radical Nature of Abraham's Call

When God called Abraham to leave his father's household, it was culturally unprecedented and offensive. This departure involved:

- Leaving economic security and provision
- Abandoning the family trade and identity
- Rejecting inherited religious beliefs and practices
- Breaking from all social relationships and support systems

##### Altar vs. Tent Theology

Abraham demonstrates proper relationship with God's promises by:

- **Building altars:** Making God's name permanent, not his own
- **Pitching tents:** Maintaining mobility and dependence on God
- This contrasts with the Tower of Babel mentality of settling and making one's own name great

##### The Egypt Experience and Character Development

Abraham's deceptive plan in Egypt reveals:

- The universal struggle between faith and self-preservation
- How even faithful people make serious moral compromises
- The unintended consequences of trying to control outcomes
- God's faithfulness despite human failure

##### The Chiastic Structure of Genesis 12

The narrative forms a chiasm (literary mirror structure) with the center being Abraham's "uh-oh moment" when his plan backfires, teaching that:

- Things don't always go according to our plans
- There are always factors we cannot see or control
- The question becomes: how will we respond to these lessons?

##### The Test of Letting Go (Chapter 13)

Abraham's decision to let Lot choose first demonstrates:

- Application of lessons learned from the Egypt experience
- Trust in God's promises despite apparent contradictions
- Willingness to release what seems essential to God's plan
- The difference between Cain and Abel's response to conflict

#### Examples & Applications

##### Real-World Parallels

- **Career Changes:** Leaving secure employment to follow a calling, similar to Abraham leaving his father's trade
- **Religious Transitions:** Converting to different faith traditions often means leaving family religious practices
- **Geographic Moves:** Relocating for ministry or mission work requires leaving familiar support systems
- **Generational Patterns:** Breaking cycles of family dysfunction or unhealthy traditions

##### Character Development Lessons

- **Learning from Mistakes:** Abraham doesn't let his failure in Egypt define him but uses it as a learning experience
- **Conflict Resolution:** Choosing peace over personal rights in disputes
- **Trust vs. Control:** Distinguishing between responsible action and trying to manipulate outcomes
- **Delayed Gratification:** Waiting for God's timing rather than forcing immediate results

##### Leadership Principles

- **Generous Authority:** Abraham, as patriarch, gives Lot first choice despite having superior position
- **Moral Courage:** Refusing to compromise integrity even when it costs materially (returning Sodom's wealth)
- **Faith Under Pressure:** Maintaining trust during famines, conflicts, and apparent contradictions

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Ancient Near Eastern Culture:** Study patriarchal societies, marriage customs, and hospitality practices
- **Covenant Theology:** Explore the progression of God's covenantal relationships from Abraham through Scripture
- **Literary Analysis:** Examine other chiastic structures in Genesis and their theological significance
- **Character Studies:** Compare Abraham's responses to crisis with other biblical figures
- **Archaeological Evidence:** Research historical evidence for Abraham's time period and geographical locations
- **Theological Ethics:** Study the tension between faith and practical responsibility in decision-making

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Cultural Context:** How does understanding ancient patriarchal culture (beit av) change your perspective on the significance of Abraham's calling to leave his father's household?

2. **Literary Structure:** What is the significance of the chiastic structure in Genesis 12, and what does Abraham's "uh-oh moment" at the center teach us about faith and planning?

3. **Character Development:** How does Abraham apply the lessons learned from his mistakes in Egypt to his conflict with Lot in Genesis 13? What does this teach us about learning from failure?

4. **Faith vs. Responsibility:** Abraham faces the tension between trusting God and taking practical action during the famine. How do believers today navigate similar tensions between faith and responsibility?

5. **The Principle of Letting Go:** Abraham twice lets Lot go, despite believing Lot was essential to God's promises being fulfilled. What does this teach us about holding our assumptions and plans with open hands?

#### Personal Summary

This episode reveals Abraham not as a perfect hero but as a relatable human being who struggles with the same tensions between faith and self-preservation that we all face. His journey from Mesopotamia to Egypt and back to Canaan becomes a masterclass in character development. The most powerful insight is how Abraham transforms his worst mistake in Egypt into wisdom that guides his future decisions. Rather than letting failure define him, he learns to trust God's character more than his own understanding. His willingness to let Lot go - twice - demonstrates mature faith that releases control while maintaining trust. Abraham's story shows us that God doesn't call perfect people but faithful people who are willing to learn, grow, and continue trusting the story even when they can't see the full picture. The episode challenges us to examine our own "Egypt moments" and consider how we might apply those lessons to trust God more deeply rather than repeat patterns of self-reliance and control.

### Original Notes

- [Genesis 12](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.12.NIV), [13](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.13.NIV), [14](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.14.NIV)
- [Gen 12:1](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.12.1.NIV) Avram leaves the house of his father.
  - This is unheard of. The house of a father was everything. EVERYONE lived under this patriarchal umbrella.
    - Beit Av, "House of the Father"
    - Decendants are there to further their father's legecy. That is their identity until their father dies.
    - A father provides everything for his children, even his gods.
    - The entire ancient world was like this. It is the Western world that brings this sense of individuality and moves away from this sense of family and community.
  - There is a story about Avram, on the night that he leaves, he breaks all of this father's idols with an ax except for one that Avram places the ax in its hands.
  - Avram pitches a tent implying he's mobile and is ready to move whenever G-d asks him to.
  - There ends up being a famine in Cannan and so Avram goes to Egypt.
    - Balance between trusting G-d and doing the responsible thing.
    - This ends up being a bad move.
  - Avram and Sarai have a plan to be treated well and leave with riches.
    - Avram has the upper hand with everyone one in Egypt except for one person, Pharoah.
    - Their story backfires in [Gen 12:14-15](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.12.14-15).
- Problems and Questions:
  - Why mention the Cannanites and Perizites? They are uneccessary in this story.
  - The mention of the tree... or something. Go back and listen for this. ~20-25 min mark.
  - Does the author want us to notice the chapters 12 and 13 as being related.
  - Avram said to Lot that they were brothers (close relative).
    - He also mentions that Sarai is his sister (close relative).
  - Why is Lot of Avram? He technically belongs to Terah at this point.
    - Avram was promised a great nation by G-d.
    - Avram out of faithfulness and trust in G-d, he takes Lot along with him believing that it will be through Lot that his great nation comes.
    - Avram and Lot part ways meaning he gives up his great nation AND he puts Lot first.
      - He continues to put others first.
  - Lot and his family is captured by Kings.
    - Avram rescues Lot and his family.
      - But then Avram gives his Lot back a second time.
- Chiasms
  - Center - 12:14-15

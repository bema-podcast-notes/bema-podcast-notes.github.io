- [Genesis 12](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.12.NIV), [13](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.13.NIV), [14](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.14.NIV)
- [Gen 12:1](https://my.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.12.1.NIV) Avram leaves the house of his father.
  - This is unheard of. The house of a father was everything. EVERYONE lived under this patriarchal umbrella.
    - Beit Av, "House of the Father"
    - Decendants are there to further their father's legecy. That is their identity until their father dies.
    - A father provides everything for his children, even his gods.
    - The entire ancient world was like this. It is the Western world that brings this sense of individuality and moves away from this sense of family and community.
  - There is a story about Avram, on the night that he leaves, he breaks all of this father's idols with an ax except for one that Avram places the ax in its hands.
  - Avram pitches a tent implying he's mobile and is ready to move whenever G-d asks him to.
  - There ends up being a famine in Cannan and so Avram goes to Egypt.
    - Balance between trusting G-d and doing the responsible thing.
    - This ends up being a bad move.
  - Avram and Sarai have a plan to be treated well and leave with riches.
    - Avram has the upper hand with everyone one in Egypt except for one person, Pharoah.
    - Their story backfires in [Gen 12:14-15](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.12.14-15).
- Problems and Questions:
  - Why mention the Cannanites and Perizites? They are uneccessary in this story.
  - The mention of the tree... or something. Go back and listen for this. ~20-25 min mark.
  - Does the author want us to notice the chapters 12 and 13 as being related.
  - Avram said to Lot that they were brothers (close relative).
    - He also mentions that Sarai is his sister (close relative).
  - Why is Lot of Avram? He technically belongs to Terah at this point.
    - Avram was promised a great nation by G-d.
    - Avram out of faithfulness and trust in G-d, he takes Lot along with him believing that it will be through Lot that his great nation comes.
    - Avram and Lot part ways meaning he gives up his great nation AND he puts Lot first.
      - He continues to put others first.
  - Lot and his family is captured by Kings.
    - Avram rescues Lot and his family.
      - But then Avram gives his Lot back a second time.

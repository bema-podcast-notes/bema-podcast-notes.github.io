Notes

- The creation story in Genesis 1. 
- Everything will build on this lesson.
- Marty has been very influenced by Rob Bell's first Everything Is Spiritual and this episode is HEAVILY influenced by that teaching.
- This G-d is a creator, a spirit, and word
- Genesis is a poem
  - Samaria. mesopatamian, other cultures maybe
  - Refrains refer to evening and morning
    - Westerners speak about this backwards, morning and evening.
  - "it was good"
  - This poem might be about something different than what we have been taught it was about.
    - Plants are created on day three BEFORE the sun is created on day four.
    - Days are being measured before days can be determined by the son.
    - This poem is certainly about creating but it's also about resting
    - Looking at day five, fish and birds go in the place that were created on day two. Days one and four correspond, two and five correspond, and three and six correspond.
    - To the Jewish, a line is drawn down the middle and this is known as a chiasm OR a chiasmus.
      - In the center of a chiasm, there is a treasure buried in the middle. A chiasm is a tool to lead a reading on a journey of discovery.
      - Parralellisms are a similar tool to chiasms.
    - Genesis 1 happens to be two chiasms in one.
      - Paragraph sizes: small (day one), medium (day two), large (day three), large (day four), medium (day five), should be small (day six) if it weren't for the creation of man. Paragraph size follows A B C C' B' A'
      - Paragraph content follows A B C A' B' C'
        - Days one and four
        - Days two and five
        - Days three and six
    - This story is NOT about logic or a science report or how G-d created the world.
      - It's about something far wider/deeper: It's about the nature of G-d, the nature of the world he created, and the nature of man.
  - What patterns are there in the poem?
    - If this is a poem, there should be a cadence and a rythm and numbers that jump out at you.
    - There is a pattern of threes 
      - Three days that mirror three days
      - Threeness of the creator: bara, spirit, word
      - The word Bara, creator, appears three times (beginning, middle, end) and at the end when it appears, it appears three times in rapid fire.
    - We would also look at seven days and expect there to be patterns of seven
      - 7x1: The first verse in the Hebrew has seven words in it 
      - 7x2: The second verse in the Hebrew has fourteen words in it
      - 7x3: The word earth appears twenty-one times in the poem
      - 7x5: There are thirty-five words in the seventh verse
      - 7x5: The word G-d is mentioned thirty-five times
      - 7x1: "It was so" seven times in the poem
      - 7x1: "G-d saw" seven times in the poem
    - If we see patterns of three and patterns of seven, the logical question to ask is, "are there patterns of ten?"
      - "to make" ten time
      - "according to its kind" ten times
      - "and G-d said" ten times
        - Three times in reference to people
        - Seven times in reference to creatures
      - "and let there be" ten times
        - Three times in reference to things in Heaven
        - Seven times in reference to things on Earth
    - This poem is FULL of patterns... it is NOT a scientific lab report.

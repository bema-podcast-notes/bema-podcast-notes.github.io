### BEMA Episode 6: A Tale of a Tower - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA E6v24 - A Tale of a Tower  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon & Brent Billings  
**Guest:** Josh Bossé  
**Topic:** The Tower of Babel narrative (Genesis 10:32-11:9) explored through Hebrew literary analysis, examining themes of technology, unity, scattering, and humanity's relationship with divine intention.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Tower of Babel story interrupts genealogical narratives, highlighting its significance in the broader redemptive story
- Technology itself is not evil - the moral issue lies in how we choose to use our capabilities
- Moving "eastward" symbolizes regression away from God's design, contrasting with westward movement toward the future
- Evil progresses from individual choices to organized societal structures throughout early Genesis narratives
- God's scattering of languages was strategic rather than punitive, creating conditions that require cooperation and learning from others
- The story parallels Cain and Abel, exploring themes of wandering, settlement, and making a name for oneself
- Learning another's language requires humility, emptying oneself, and genuine care for others' perspectives
- True progress requires learning to work together across differences rather than building towers of isolation

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Literary Structure and Chiasm

The Tower of Babel narrative forms a chiasm (symmetrical literary structure) with Genesis 11:4 at its center. Hebrew consonant patterns (N-B-L-H) appear in forward order in the first half and reverse order in the second half, indicating intentional literary design. This structure emphasizes the central verse about building a tower "to make a name for ourselves."

##### Directional Symbolism: East vs. West

- **East:** Symbolizes the past, regression, moving away from God's intentions
- **West:** Represents the future, progress toward God's design
- The sun's daily journey from east to west provided this metaphorical framework for ancient readers
- The narrative describes people moving eastward, indicating spiritual and moral regression

##### The Progression of Evil

Throughout Genesis, evil evolves organizationally:

1. **Individual choice:** Adam and Eve's disobedience
2. **Family conflict:** Cain and Abel's fraternal violence
3. **Societal corruption:** Pre-flood wickedness
4. **Organized civilization:** The Tower of Babel representing systematized rebellion

##### Technology and Moral Responsibility

The text demonstrates a Hebrew literary principle through dialogue structure. When characters say something, accomplish it, then speak again with "And they said," it indicates a pause in the narrative. God's silence after the brick-making technology suggests divine neutrality toward technological innovation itself. God only intervenes when the technology is applied toward prideful, oppressive purposes.

##### The Nimrod Connection

Rabbinic tradition and textual analysis connect Nimrod (described as the first "gibor" - mighty warrior/hunter) with the Tower of Babel project. Nimrod's kingdom included Babylon (Hebrew: "Babel") in the land of Shinar, the same location as the tower. His name means "rebel," and he represents organized opposition to divine authority.

##### Language as Divine Strategy

The confusion of languages serves multiple redemptive purposes:

- Prevents premature technological advancement without moral development
- Creates conditions requiring cooperation across differences
- Forces humanity to learn humility through language acquisition
- Establishes prerequisites for accomplishing great things: caring for others' welfare

##### Parallels with Cain and Abel

Both narratives explore themes of:

- **Wandering vs. Settlement:** Cain was cursed to wander but built a city; Babel's builders feared scattering but were scattered
- **Name-making:** Cain named his city after his son; Babel's builders sought to "make a name" for themselves
- **Sacrifice and reaching heaven:** Abel's accepted sacrifice vs. the tower reaching toward heaven
- **Divine intervention:** God's preventive action in both cases

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Technology Ethics

Like the ancient brick-making innovation, contemporary technologies (internet, artificial intelligence, genetic engineering) are morally neutral. The ethical dimension emerges in application: Will these tools serve human flourishing and divine purposes, or will they enable oppression and pride?

##### Cultural and Political Polarization

The Tower of Babel speaks directly to modern tribalism and political polarization. When groups refuse to learn others' "languages" (perspectives, experiences, cultures), they remain scattered and unable to accomplish constructive goals together.

##### Language Learning as Spiritual Practice

Acquiring a foreign language requires fundamental humility - admitting ignorance, depending on others for basic communication, and gradually understanding different worldviews. This process mirrors spiritual growth and cross-cultural ministry.

##### Corporate and Institutional Pride

Modern institutions can mirror Nimrod's tower-building project when they prioritize making a name for themselves over serving others. This applies to churches, businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations that become self-serving rather than others-focused.

##### Team Dynamics and Cooperation

The episode's discussion of teamwork challenges reflects broader human tendencies to prioritize individual agendas over collaborative efforts. Learning to "say enough" to personal ambitions enables genuine partnership with others.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Midrashic Literature on Nimrod

Jewish traditional commentary contains extensive material on Nimrod's character and role in the Tower of Babel narrative. Exploring these traditions could deepen understanding of how Jewish interpreters connected seemingly separate biblical texts.

##### Ancient Near Eastern Tower Narratives

Comparing the biblical Tower of Babel with other ancient Mesopotamian accounts of ziggurat construction and divine-human conflicts could illuminate unique aspects of the Hebrew narrative.

##### Hebrew Linguistic Analysis

Detailed study of the consonant patterns, word relationships, and grammatical structures could reveal additional literary artistry in the original text.

##### New Testament Connections

Examining how Jesus addressed themes of unity across diversity, particularly in teachings about loving enemies and the Pentecost narrative in Acts 2, could show how these themes develop throughout Scripture.

##### Sociological Studies of Language and Power

Research into how language policies and multilingual societies function could provide contemporary parallels to the Tower of Babel's themes about communication and social organization.

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Literary Analysis:** How does the chiastic structure of the Tower of Babel narrative emphasize its central message, and what does Genesis 11:4 reveal about the builders' primary motivation?

2. **Thematic Connections:** In what specific ways do the Tower of Babel and Cain and Abel narratives parallel each other, and what does this suggest about the progression of human moral choices in Genesis?

3. **Technology and Ethics:** According to the episode's analysis, why does God remain silent when humans develop brick-making technology but intervene when they announce their building plans? What principle does this establish for evaluating technological innovation?

4. **Divine Strategy:** How is God's scattering of languages and peoples presented as strategic rather than punitive, and what conditions does this create for future human flourishing?

5. **Contemporary Application:** How do the Tower of Babel's themes about learning others' languages and perspectives apply to modern challenges of political polarization, cultural diversity, and international cooperation?

#### Personalized Summary

The Tower of Babel narrative reveals profound insights about human nature, technological responsibility, and divine wisdom that remain strikingly relevant today. Rather than a simple story about divine punishment for human pride, this account presents a sophisticated exploration of how God works to redirect human potential toward constructive rather than destructive ends.

The story's literary artistry - its chiastic structure and consonant patterns - demonstrates the care with which biblical authors crafted their narratives to convey multiple layers of meaning. The connection to Nimrod, the first organized warrior-ruler, shows how evil progresses from individual choices to systematized oppression, while the geographical movement eastward symbolizes humanity's regression away from divine design.

Most importantly, the confusion of languages emerges not as divine vindictiveness but as loving strategy. By creating conditions that require cross-cultural learning and cooperation, God ensures that humanity's greatest achievements will only be possible when people learn to empty themselves, listen carefully to others, and work for mutual rather than selfish benefit.

This ancient wisdom speaks directly to contemporary challenges of technological ethics, cultural polarization, and the tension between individual achievement and community wellbeing. The call to learn others' languages - whether literal linguistic acquisition or metaphorical perspective-taking - remains as relevant today as it was in ancient Babel. The story ultimately points toward a redemptive vision where human diversity becomes a strength rather than a barrier, enabling collaborative work toward God's intentions for creation.

### BEMA Episode 6: A Tale of a Tower - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Episode 6: A Tale of a Tower (2016)**  
This episode examines the Tower of Babel narrative from Genesis 10:32-11:9, exploring themes of human rebellion, technology, language confusion, and God's redemptive purposes. The hosts analyze the story through Hebrew literary structure, geographical symbolism, and theological implications.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Tower of Babel story follows a chiastic structure centered on God's desire to scatter humanity
- Eastward movement in Genesis represents increasing distance from God's original intent
- God's confusion of languages was not punishment but a redemptive project to teach cooperation
- Technology itself is not evil - the issue is how humanity chooses to use it
- Evil progresses from individual rebellion to organized civilizational corruption
- God scatters people to prevent them from settling in their rebellious state
- The story parallels Cain and Abel, with scattering echoing Cain's curse of wandering

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### **Chiastic Structure Analysis**

The Hebrew text reveals a sophisticated literary pattern using consonants N-B-L-H that reverse halfway through the narrative. This chiasm centers on the phrase about scattering in Genesis 11:4b, making scattering the focal point rather than the tower itself. This structure parallels other Genesis narratives, suggesting intentional literary craftsmanship.

##### **Geographical Symbolism of East vs. West**

Throughout Genesis, eastward movement represents spiritual distance from God:

- Adam and Eve leave Eden toward the east
- Cain's lineage moves east after his curse
- Post-flood humanity continues moving east
- The Tower of Babel represents the culmination of this eastern drift

This geographical pattern suggests that "west" symbolizes return to God's presence and original design.

##### **Progressive Nature of Evil**

The episode traces evil's evolution from individual (Adam and Eve) to family (Cain and Abel) to civilization (Tower of Babel). This escalation shows evil becoming increasingly organized and systematic, requiring divine intervention to prevent complete corruption.

##### **Technology and Human Creativity**

The narrative distinguishes between technological innovation and its application:

- Brick-making represents neutral technological advancement
- God doesn't object to the technology itself
- The problem arises when technology serves selfish purposes ("make a name for ourselves")
- Modern parallels include internet, cell phones, and other innovations that can serve good or destructive ends

##### **Divine Response as Redemptive Strategy**

God's confusion of languages serves multiple redemptive purposes:

- Forces humanity to learn cooperation and teamwork
- Requires understanding different perspectives and cultures
- Develops patience and self-control necessary for collaboration
- Creates conditions where humans must grow into God's image through working together

#### Examples & Applications

##### **Modern Technology Parallels**

- Internet: Powerful tool for education and connection, but also enables harmful content and isolation
- Social Media: Can build communities and spread knowledge, or create division and misinformation
- Artificial Intelligence: Offers tremendous benefits for healthcare and productivity, but raises ethical concerns about control and application

##### **Language Learning and Cultural Understanding**

The Babel principle applies to modern cross-cultural communication:

- Learning another language requires understanding different worldviews
- International cooperation demands patience and humility
- Multicultural teams often produce more creative and effective solutions
- Global challenges require collaborative approaches that transcend individual or national interests

##### **Urban Planning and Community Development**

The desire to "build a city" and "make a name for ourselves" reflects modern tendencies:

- Corporate ambitions that prioritize brand recognition over community benefit
- Urban development that serves developers rather than residents
- Technological projects focused on legacy rather than genuine human need

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### **Hebrew Language and Literary Structure**

- Deeper study of consonantal patterns in Hebrew scripture
- Comparative analysis of chiastic structures across Genesis narratives
- Investigation of how Hebrew literary techniques communicate theological meaning

##### **Ancient Near Eastern Context**

- Historical background of ziggurats and tower-building in Mesopotamia
- Comparative mythology surrounding language origins and divine intervention
- Archaeological evidence for ancient Babylon and Shinar region

##### **Theological Implications of Divine Intervention**

- How God's intervention in human affairs relates to free will and sovereignty
- The relationship between divine judgment and redemptive purpose
- Biblical patterns of God using apparent setbacks to achieve greater purposes

##### **Geography and Spirituality in Scripture**

- Symbolic significance of directional movement throughout biblical narrative
- The role of place and displacement in spiritual formation
- How physical geography reflects spiritual realities in biblical thought

##### **Technology Ethics and Stewardship**

- Biblical principles for evaluating technological advancement
- The relationship between human creativity and divine image-bearing
- Developing frameworks for ethical technology use in contemporary contexts

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How does the chiastic structure of the Tower of Babel story change our understanding of its central message, and what does this suggest about Hebrew storytelling techniques?**

2. **Explain the pattern of eastward movement throughout Genesis and its symbolic significance. How does this geographical motif connect the Tower of Babel to earlier narratives?**

3. **Why does God approve of brick-making but intervene when the people decide to build a tower? What principle does this distinction illustrate about technology and human motivation?**

4. **In what ways does God's confusion of languages serve as a "redemptive project" rather than punishment? How might this apply to modern challenges requiring international cooperation?**

5. **How does the Tower of Babel story parallel the account of Cain and Abel, and what does this suggest about the progressive nature of human rebellion described in Genesis?**

#### Personal Summary

The Tower of Babel narrative reveals itself as far more than a simple explanation for linguistic diversity. Through careful analysis of its Hebrew literary structure and geographical symbolism, we discover a sophisticated theological reflection on human nature, technology, and divine redemption. The story warns against the tendency to use our God-given creativity for self-aggrandizement rather than collaborative blessing.

The episode's insights about technology remain strikingly relevant: innovation itself is neutral, but our motivations and applications determine whether it serves destructive or redemptive purposes. God's response to human pride - confusing languages to force cooperation - demonstrates how apparent setbacks can serve larger redemptive goals. The requirement to learn other languages and perspectives in order to accomplish great things provides a powerful metaphor for how spiritual growth often requires humility, patience, and genuine engagement with others.

Most significantly, the eastward drift throughout Genesis represents humanity's tendency to move away from God's original design, while God's scattering serves to prevent permanent settlement in rebellion. This pattern suggests that divine intervention often aims not to punish but to preserve the possibility of eventual return and restoration.

### Original Notes

- Genesis 10:32 - 11:9
- Problems:
  - We see the people trying to become more Eastern and G-d says no which seems to go against everything we've been talking about.
    - Westerners don't notice this but so far, we read about people heading east (Adam and Eve go East when leaving the garden; Cain and his family heads East) but when we get to Noah and the flood, G-d brings them back West. When they leave the ark, they head East. People continue to move farther and farther away from where G-d has intended for them to be.
  - People are worried about being scattered before G-d actually scatters them.
  - How does everyone speak a single language?
- Chiasm
  - Center: 11:4 "scattered all over the earth"
    - Beginning 10:32 compare end 11:8-9
    - It's difficult to see in the English but it's there
  - The Hebrew consonants are very repetitive in this story: n b l h
    - These consonant appear in the same order and then halfway through the story they reverse.
  - There is language at scattering at the beginning, end, and the middle.
- Story parallels:
  - Noah and the flood parallels the creation story
  - Noah and the curse parallels Adam and Eve
  - The Tower of Babel should parallel Cain and Abel
    - Cain's curse was to wander the earth.
    - Cain's worry was about making a name for himself and aquiring.
      - In this story, they desire to "make a name for [themselves]" and aquiring "a tower that reaches to the heavens".
    - The people are caused to scatter and wander.
    - Does the center of this chiasm mean G-d wants his people to wander and not to settle, or be in a fixed state, away from his will, or we might say "East".
      - Are the allusions to the Garden of Eden where G-d doesn't want his people to settle until they are at home, West?
      - Some concerns: Why is G-d threatened by their technological advancements (the brick)? Don't we read later that G-d wants use to be able to do anything?
        - Is it more about trusting in G-d's story and knowing when to say enough?
        - G-d won't let them setting so he scatters mankind.
- When a story mentions "and then he said" there is an interruption in the story, that is, a time has passed.
  - I have questions about the following statements that Marty makes about how "and then he/they said" here.
  - Marty says that G-d is silent about the creation of the brick and only speaks up when it begins to be used improperly.
  - The phrase used in the NIV is 11:6 "The Lord said..." rather than "And then he said". I was previously under the impression that these would not have both meant an interruption in dialog.
- Fohrman teaches that G-d disrupts their language because of the following:
  > It's interesting to note that in order for humanity to progress as a whole, they will need to learn the language of others. You cannot learn the language of another culture or a people without learning something about their perspective. Learning the diversity of perspectives always provides one with a sense of pause and consideration. It requires a sense of learning how to control one's desires in order to reach a common goal together. In the confusion of Babel, G-d has not so much slapped our hands as he has given us a new redemptive project that will cause us to be the people that grows into the kind of humanity that bears his image, a humanity that knows when to say enough; a people that trusts the story, a people that just might find a place of rest.
  - When G-d confuses the people, what he says is if you want to succeed, you're going to have to learn how to work together.
    - "A selfless group of people who knows how to put other ahead of self"
    - This is a story about G-d setting his people up for success.
- G-d will end up finding someone who is willing to go West and partner with G-d.

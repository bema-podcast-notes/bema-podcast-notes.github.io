### BEMA Episode 20: With All Your Heart - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 20: With All Your Heart (2025)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon, Brent Billings, with guest Reed Dent  
**Topic:** The story of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea and their first test on the journey to Mount Sinai, focusing on God's testing of their hearts through the bitter waters at Marah and the provision of manna.

#### Key Takeaways

- God's tests are not pass/fail assessments but opportunities for mutual experience - for us to show God what's in our hearts and to learn and grow in relationship with Him
- The Hebrew word for "know" (yada) implies intimate, experiential knowing rather than mere cerebral knowledge
- The Kingdom of God comes through three components: God's finger moving, people calling Him Lord, and people responding in obedience
- Testing in the Hebrew mindset involves both giving (showing God our hearts) and getting (learning from God)
- The heart (lev) in Hebrew thought represents the seat of will and choice, not just emotions
- Community care, particularly for the marginalized and weak, is central to God's expectations for His people
- The manna provision demonstrates God's desire for daily dependence rather than anxious accumulation

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Nature of Divine Testing

Testing (Hebrew: nasah) is fundamentally different from Western academic testing. God doesn't test to see if we pass or fail, but rather to experience our spiritual journey with us. The testing is like testing strips in a hot tub - measuring where we are to determine what we need next, not to grade us.

##### The Threefold Coming of the Kingdom

Jewish teaching identifies three necessary components for experiencing God's Kingdom on earth:

1. **The finger of God moves** - God acts and intervenes
2. **People call Him Lord** - Recognition and worship of God's authority  
3. **People respond in obedience** - Active submission to God's will

All three elements must be present for the full experience of God's Kingdom.

##### Biblical Knowing (Yada)

The Hebrew word yada represents intimate, experiential knowledge rather than intellectual data. When God wants to "know" what's in our hearts, He desires to experience our growth journey with us, not merely collect information about us.

##### The Heart as Seat of Will

In Hebrew thought, the heart (lev) is the center of volition and choice, not primarily emotions. The test of the heart examines what we will choose when faced with God's instructions.

##### Creation Language in Deliverance

The Red Sea crossing mirrors creation imagery - waters being separated, dry ground appearing, God's breath (wind) moving over the waters. This suggests that God's deliverance creates new realities using the same power that formed the original creation.

#### Examples & Applications

##### The Red Sea Crossing

- **Geographic Context:** The Israelites headed south toward a dead end rather than taking the logical northern coastal route, demonstrating God's unconventional methods
- **Dual Accounts:** Exodus 14 provides more historiographic language (east wind, Moses' staff) while Exodus 15 uses poetic language (God's nostrils, right hand), showing different registers for communicating the same divine reality

##### The Bitter Waters at Marah

- **Wordplay:** Marah means both "bitter" and "rebellious," highlighting the people's spiritual state
- **The Test:** According to Midrash, the statute given was that the weak and marginalized should drink first from the one well
- **God's Provision:** Just around the corner were 12 springs and 70 palm trees - abundance following the test of scarcity

##### The Manna Provision

- **Daily Dependence:** Gathering only what was needed each day taught trust rather than anxiety-driven accumulation
- **Sabbath Preparation:** Double gathering on the sixth day introduced Sabbath observance
- **Community Care:** Rabbinical interpretation suggests those who could gather more shared with those who couldn't, ensuring everyone had exactly what they needed

##### Desert Experience Perspective

Modern visitors to the Sinai wilderness gain appreciation for the Israelites' complaints - the heat radiating off canyon walls can feel like "baking in an oven," making survival concerns very real rather than faithless whining.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- The connection between manna sharing and Paul's teaching in 2 Corinthians 8 about Christian generosity
- The relationship between Moses and God as sometimes distinct, sometimes seemingly unified agents
- The role of Midrash in understanding biblical narratives and filling textual gaps
- Martin Buber's concept of "imaginative remembering" in biblical historiography
- The parallel between creation and redemption throughout Hebrew scripture
- Walter Brueggemann's work on biblical narrative and theological interpretation
- The concept of right-handed vs. left-handed power in understanding God's kingdom versus earthly empires
- Jewish numerology and symbolism in biblical narratives (12 wells, 70 palm trees)
- The significance of the pillar of cloud moving from front to back during the Red Sea crossing

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Explain the difference between biblical "testing" (nasah) and modern academic testing. How does understanding this difference change your perspective on trials in your own life?**

2. **What are the three components necessary for the Kingdom of God to come according to Jewish teaching, and how do you see these playing out (or not) in contemporary Christian communities?**

3. **How does the Hebrew concept of yada (knowing) help us understand what God desires in His relationship with us, and what does this suggest about the purpose of spiritual challenges?**

4. **According to the Midrashic interpretation of the Marah incident, what was the statute God gave the Israelites, and how does this connect to broader biblical themes about community care?**

5. **How do the dual accounts of the Red Sea crossing in Exodus 14 and 15 demonstrate different ways of communicating truth about God's intervention in history?**

#### Personal Summary

This episode reveals God's heart as a patient teacher who uses tests not to grade us but to journey with us toward spiritual maturity. The Israelites' complaints in the wilderness become more understandable when we consider the harsh realities of desert survival, reminding us to approach biblical characters with humility rather than condescension.

The central lesson emerges through the testing of their hearts: God desires a people who will choose daily dependence on His word, care for the vulnerable in their community, and trust His provision even when it seems impossible. The manna's daily provision and the requirement to let the marginalized drink first at Marah both point toward a Kingdom economy based on trust and generosity rather than anxiety and accumulation.

Most significantly, God's desire to "know" (yada) what's in our hearts reveals His longing for intimate, experiential relationship rather than distant observation. He doesn't test us to discover information He lacks, but to experience our growth journey with us, celebrating our steps forward and patiently working with us through our failures. This transforms our understanding of both divine testing and spiritual formation - from performance-based religion to participatory relationship with a God who genuinely desires to walk through life with us.

### BEMA Episode 20: With All Your Heart - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 20: With All Your Heart (2017)  
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 14-15  
**Main Topics:** The Israelites crossing the Red Sea, the first wilderness test at Marah, and understanding biblical testing as experiential knowing rather than pass/fail evaluation.

#### Key Takeaways

- The "Red Sea" is actually the "Sea of Reeds" (Hebrew: Yam Suph), though the exact location remains debated among scholars
- God's testing is not about pass/fail but about experiential knowing (yada) - God wants to experience what's in our hearts
- The threefold coming of God's kingdom requires: (1) the finger of God working, (2) calling on the name of the Lord, and (3) responding in obedience
- Every wilderness test is designed to teach aspects of community and how obedience impacts communal life
- Waiting on "every word from the mouth of the Lord" means trusting God's timing for provision rather than demanding immediate sustenance

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tale of Two Kingdoms

**Empire vs. Shalom:**

- **Empire:** Fear, coercion, dominating power (symbolized by Pharaoh's outstretched hand with a stick)
- **Shalom:** Trust, invitation, power through self-sacrifice (symbolized by God's deliverance)

##### The Threefold Coming of the Kingdom

Based on Jewish teaching, the kingdom of God comes through three essential elements:

1. **The Finger of God Works** - Divine intervention and power (referenced by Egyptian magicians in Exodus)
2. **Calling on the Name of the Lord** - Recognition and worship of God as Lord (*Adonai emloch ha'olam va'ed* - "The Lord reigns forever and ever")
3. **Responding in Obedience** - Active submission to God's will through righteous living

##### Biblical Testing (Nisah)

**Hebrew Understanding of Testing:**

- Not pass/fail evaluation but opportunity for experiential knowing
- **Yada** - intimate, experiential knowledge (same word used for sexual intimacy)
- Two-way gift exchange:
  - **Gift to God:** Showing Him what's in our hearts
  - **Gift from God:** Learning new lessons about His character and ways

##### The Geography of Exodus

**Route Details:**

- Israelites initially headed east from Goshen
- God commanded them to turn south toward the sea (appearing lost/confused to Pharaoh)
- This strategic misdirection prompted Pharaoh's pursuit
- Crossing occurred at an unknown location along the Red Sea/Sea of Reeds

#### Examples & Applications

##### The First Wilderness Test: Marah (Exodus 15:22-27)

**The Situation:**

- Three days without water after crossing the sea
- Arrived at Marah where water was bitter/undrinkable
- People grumbled against Moses

**The Lesson:**

- **Marah** means both "bitter" and "rebellious" - dual symbolism of bitter water and rebellious hearts
- Moses threw wood (not his staff) into water, making it sweet
- God established "law and statute" - according to midrash, requiring community care (letting sick, elderly, and marginalized drink first)

**The Provision:**

- Immediately after the test, they found Elim with 12 springs (one for each tribe) and 70 palm trees (communal sufficiency)
- Demonstrates God's abundant provision when His people wait on His word

##### Modern Applications of the Threefold Kingdom

**Contemporary Challenges:**

- Some people live righteously but never acknowledge God as Lord (missing element #2)
- Many Christians claim God as Lord but don't respond in obedience (missing element #3)
- True kingdom requires all three elements working together

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Historical and Archaeological Studies

- Archaeological evidence for Exodus route and Red Sea crossing locations
- Ancient Egyptian records of Hebrew departure and Red Sea events
- Comparative analysis of ancient Near Eastern crossing narratives

##### Theological Deep Dives

- Relationship between divine sovereignty and human testing
- Community ethics in wilderness narratives
- Typological connections between Exodus and Jesus' ministry

##### Hebrew Language and Culture

- Further study of *yada* (experiential knowing) throughout Scripture
- Exploration of *levav* (heart as will/seat of decision-making)
- Rabbinic interpretation methods (midrash) and their applications

##### Practical Applications

- Implementing community-first ethics in modern church contexts
- Understanding trials as opportunities for spiritual growth rather than punishment
- Balancing trust in God's provision with responsible action

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **What is the difference between the Hebrew concept of testing (nisah) and Western understanding of testing, and why is this distinction important for understanding God's relationship with His people?**

2. **Explain the threefold coming of the kingdom and provide examples of how each element might be missing in contemporary Christian life. How did Jesus teach this concept?**

3. **What was the significance of the location change from bitter waters at Marah to abundant provision at Elim, and what does this teach about God's timing and provision?**

4. **How does the Hebrew word *yada* (experiential knowing) change our understanding of why God tests His people, given that He already knows all things intellectually?**

5. **What role did community care play in the first wilderness test at Marah, and how does this connect to the broader theme that every wilderness test teaches aspects of community life?**

#### Personal Summary

Episode 20 presents the dramatic crossing of the Red Sea as more than just a miraculous rescue - it's the beginning of Israel's education in kingdom living. The transition from Egypt to wilderness represents moving from empire's way of fear and coercion to Shalom's way of trust and invitation. God's testing isn't about our performance but about intimate relationship - He wants to experience what's truly in our hearts, not just know it intellectually.

The story of Marah reveals God's teaching method: apparent scarcity followed by abundant provision, but only after the lesson is learned. The bitter water becoming sweet through Moses' wood, followed immediately by twelve springs and seventy palm trees at Elim, demonstrates that God's delays aren't denials. He provides exactly what we need exactly when we need it, often exceeding our expectations when we learn to wait on His word.

The threefold coming of the kingdom challenges both secular righteousness and shallow Christianity. True kingdom living requires divine power, authentic worship, and obedient action working together. This ancient wisdom speaks directly to modern discipleship, calling us beyond mere intellectual belief to experiential partnership with God in putting the world back together.

### Original Notes

- Review
  - Talked about the book of Genesis, the preface (ch 1-11) and introduction (12-50) to his larger narrative.
    - Genesis 1-11
      - Introduces the the basic premises of his story
      - He's made a good creation
      - He invites that creation to trust that they are good; that they are enough... and to not live in fear and insecurity
    - Genesis 12-50
      - We meet the family of God through Abraham, the father of faith.
      - This is a family that G-d wants to use. They have hutzpah, hospitality, compassion and that's the kind of stuff that G-d wants to use.
    - G-d's narrative then begins
      - Empire vs Shalom
      - They way of Pharaoh
        - Empire is about greed, wealth, and power.
      - If Empire is about fear, Shalom is about trust.
      - If Empire is about coercion, Shalom is about invitation.
      - If Empire is about a particular type of power--a dominator power, Shalom is a kind of power that comes from self-sacrifice.
    - G-d is after Pharaoh's heart and want's Pharaoh to experience him as G-d--To yeda G-d just as his people yeda him.
      - Will Pharaoh bow his knee and adopt a worldview that puts that world back together or not. The answer is no.
      - G-d then invites his people to adopt this worldview and to work with him to put the world back together just as their ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, partnered with G-d to do the same thing.
- Exodus 14
  - Exodus 14:1-4
    - G-d tells Moshe to tell the Israelites to camp between Migdol and the sea in order to confuse Pharaoh who will think they are wandering around in the desert.
    - Red Sea in no way can be interpreted as Red Sea. It should be interpreted the "Sea of Reeds". See the presentation for more info.
      - Is it possible that the Red Sea as we know it could be known as the Sea of Reeds? Yes it is but we do not have any record of that.
      - The Text talks about the Israelites walking through WALLS of water.
      - G-d tells them to head South and Pharaoh will think that you're crazy. Once the reach further south, they will cross the sea.
      - There are 19 respected opinions of where Sinai is. There are about as many opinions of where they crossed as well. BEMA will not try to make a decision about that.
  - Exodus 14:10
    - The people become angry with Moshe and ask why he brought them out to the desert to die instead of leaving them in Egypt to serve the Egyptians like they asked.
    - Moshe responds by telling them to stand firm and they will see G-d deliver them.
    - Verse 16 mentions Moshe's staff which is used to symbolize the power of G-d.
    - Verse 21 mentions ruach, "with a strong east wind".
      - Brent mentions how interesting the mention of "east" means.
      - If it's coming out of the the east and toward the west, it would symbolize judgement. Would that be judgement of Pharaoh? This will happen a lot of Tanach which will symbolize the judgement of G-d.
    - Three-Fold Coming of Kingdom
      - Ingredients
        - The finger of G-d works
          - You can find examples of this in lots of ways. G-d works over and over.
          - The magicians told Pharaoh after one of the plagues, you need to stop resisting G-d because this is the "finger of G-d."
          - Not only the plagues but also on the Western beach of the Red Sea, we see the finger of G-d moving.
        - People call him Lord
          - When you get to the Eastern beach of the Red Sea, they call of the name of the Lord as a people (first time this has happened as a group) saying "He is our G-d."
          - This would be the name that G-d revealed to Moshe. YHWH (Yod-He-Vav-He).
        - People respond in obedience
          - Once they get to Sinai, the respond in obedience once they are given the law and you get a kingdom of priests.
      - Where does this idea of kingdom come from?
        - In Exodus 19, G-d tells the Israelites if they enter into a covenant with him, they will be for him a kingdom of priests.
        - Later in Judaism they connect this idea to a kingdom with this story in Exodus 19.
        - Looking at this Exodus story they identified the three things that always happens when kingdom comes.
        - There are times when people simply call on the name of the Lord and believe that Kingdom has come but the Jewish Sages would argue that you HAVE to respond in obedience in order for kingdom to come.
        - Marty argues that Jesus taught this:
          - Jesus said, If I cast out demons by the finger of G-d, then the kingdom of G-d has come among you.
          - Later in his teaching Jesus said, Not everyone who has said to me, Lord Lord, will enter the kingdom of Heaven but only those who do the will of my father who is in Heaven.
          - Marty believes Jesus directly taught this three-fold coming of kingdom.
      - The Israelites finish crossing the Red Sea and G-d takes them on a 40-day journey Mount Sinai.
        - On this 40-day journey, G-d is going to test them three times.
          - Brent: Three is a number of community.
        - God wants to test their heart, their soul, and their might.
        - The idea of testing
          - The Hebrew idea of testing is NOT Pass-Fail like the Western view of testing is.
          - The Hebrew idea G-d of testing his people is for G-d to "know" what was in there heart.
          - Doesn't G-d already know everything?
          - G-d wants to yada what is in the heart of his people experientially. This is not a cerebral kind of knowing.
          - Yada has a lot of sexual overtones. It's a very intimate kind of knowing. Adam yada-ed Eve.
          - This means that a testing is an opportunity and there are two gifts that can be given with a test.
            1. A gift that we get to give to G-d. A test is always an opportunity to show G-d what's in your heart and to show him your willingness to be obedient. Not to be perfect but he gets to experience where you are in your growth.
            2. A gift from G-d to us because a testing is always an opportunity to learn a new lesson from G-d.
        - Marah, the place of water.
          - Exodus 15:22-27
            - This is test number one on the way to Sinai and G-d wants to know what's in their heart.
            - The Hebrew word for heart is levav and when the Hebrew says heart, they mean "your will." Worship comes from your will. To the Jewish mind, they connect worship to obedience.
              - The fact that you would willingly obey G-d is an act of worship because you're submitting your will to G-d's desire.
            - The Rabbis go back to Deuteronomy 8:1-5 to teach that this is a test of their heart. They want to know if they would willingly wait on every word.
            - Moshe should know about this well because this is where he spent 40 years himself as a shepherd after leaving Egypt.
              - He leads them to this well knowing that they'll be able to drink.
              - When they get to the well it's bitter so this is why the call it Marah, yes? No. Marah has a much deeper meaning that just a bitter taste.
              - There seems to be a dual edge in all of the rabbi's teachings because there is a sense of a rebellious son. To be marah is to be defiantly and stubbornly rebellious.
              - You would stone a rebellious son.
              - It's not about bitter water, it's about a rebellious people.
              - Moshe takes a stick, not his stick but a different stick, and throws it into the water and the water becomes fit to drink.
              - G-d then issues a law and a ruling.
              - Some people read what's next, they think this is the statute but it's not really a law or a statute and so the Rabbis ask, "what was the law and what was the statute?"
              - The Midrash tells that the law and the statute was that when they went to drink from the well, they had to let the lame, elderly, sick, and marginalized go first.
                - The Midrash goes on to teach G-d is wanting to teach the Israelites with every test in the desert is supposed to teach some aspect of community.
                - They are supposed to learn that obedience and how obedience impacts community.
            - After they drink the waters from Marah, they turn the corner and come upon 12 springs and 70 palm trees and they camped near the water.
              - Significance of 12.
                - There is enough for everybody--one well for each tribe.
              - Significance of 70.
                - This is also a communal number.
                - It will come back later in the text.
            - If they would have only waited on the word of G-d, he would have given them enough for everyone. G-d uses this first test to not only experience what was in their hearts but to also teach them a lesson.

### BEMA Episode 31: Remember Where You Came From - Study Notes (2025)

#### Title & Source Summary
This episode concludes Session 1's study of Torah by examining the book of Deuteronomy, with particular focus on its central themes of remembering one's story and caring for marginalized people. The hosts explore how Deuteronomy functions as Moses's final teaching, emphasizing the Hebrew concepts of "zakar" (remember) and "shakach" (forget), and how these connect to caring for foreigners, orphans, and widows.

#### Key Takeaways
- The book of Deuteronomy contains 14 references to "zakar" (remember) and 9 references to not forgetting ("shakach"), emphasizing the critical importance of remembering one's story
- The recurring phrase "Remember that you were slaves in Egypt" serves as the foundation for how God's people should treat marginalized groups
- Caring for foreigners, orphans, and widows is not optional charity but a fundamental requirement based on remembering one's own experience of marginalization
- When we remember our own past vulnerability, we naturally notice and care for those who are currently vulnerable
- Moses's epitaph emphasizes his intimate relationship with God ("face to face") rather than his failure to enter the Promised Land
- Deuteronomy follows the structure of ancient suzerain-vassal covenants, making it familiar to its original audience
- Remembering is an active spiritual discipline, not a passive mental activity

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Structure of Torah as Covenant
Deuteronomy follows the five-part structure of ancient suzerain-vassal covenants:
1. **Preamble** (Deuteronomy 1a) - Introductory setup
2. **Historical Summary** (Deuteronomy 1b-4) - The story of how the relationship began
3. **Stipulations** (Deuteronomy 5-26) - Laws and demands
4. **Rewards and Punishments** (Deuteronomy 28) - Consequences for obedience/disobedience
5. **Conclusion** (Deuteronomy 32) - The Song of Moses for memorization

This structure would have been familiar to ancient audiences and demonstrates God's accommodation to their cultural understanding while subverting typical power dynamics by placing God, not a human ruler, as the suzerain.

##### The Hebrew Concept of Remembering (Zakar)
The Hebrew word "zakar" appears 14 times in Deuteronomy and carries deeper meaning than simple mental recall. It involves:
- Active engagement with one's story and identity
- Communal storytelling and intergenerational transmission
- Connection between past experience and present behavior
- Recognition that remembering shapes how we see and treat others

##### The Foreigner-Orphan-Widow Triad
This recurring grouping represents the most vulnerable in ancient society:
- **Foreigners** had no tribal protection or land rights
- **Orphans** lacked family support systems
- **Widows** had no economic security in a patriarchal society

These groups serve as a test of whether a community operates by Empire (pushing the vulnerable to margins) or Shalom (bringing the vulnerable to the center).

##### Empire vs. Shalom Paradigm
The episode references this ongoing biblical theme:
- **Empire** marginalizes the weak and vulnerable for efficiency and power
- **Shalom** centers the vulnerable and builds community around their needs
- God's people are called to reject Empire patterns and embrace Shalom living

#### Examples & Applications

##### Ancient Social Safety Net
Deuteronomy describes practical systems for caring for the vulnerable:
- **Gleaning laws** - Leaving portions of harvest for the poor
- **Third-year tithe** - Community collection and redistribution
- **Festival inclusion** - Marginalized groups invited to celebrations
- **Levirate marriage** - System to protect widows from destitution
- **Justice requirements** - Legal protection for the vulnerable

##### Modern Application of Remembering
The principle applies beyond ancient Israel:
- Nations built by immigrants forgetting their immigrant story
- Individuals who experienced poverty forgetting to help the poor
- Communities that received help in crisis times forgetting to help others in crisis
- Churches that were once marginalized forgetting to welcome the marginalized

##### Moses's Death as Success Redefinition
Rather than seeing Moses's exclusion from the Promised Land as failure, the text emphasizes:
- His unique intimacy with God ("face to face")
- His death "by the mouth of the Lord" (potentially meaning a divine kiss)
- His unparalleled role in Israel's story
- The idea that success is measured by relationship with God, not achievement of goals

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration
- Comparative study of ancient Near Eastern covenant structures and their influence on biblical literature
- The role of communal memory in shaping group identity and ethics
- Examination of other biblical books that emphasize remembering (Psalms, prophetic literature)
- Modern applications of gleaning laws and social safety nets in contemporary contexts
- The theology of divine accommodation in Scripture (God working within human cultural frameworks)
- The concept of "face to face" relationship with God throughout Scripture
- How the Empire vs. Shalom paradigm appears in New Testament writings
- The role of festivals and celebrations in maintaining cultural memory
- Biblical principles for immigration and refugee care
- The connection between personal spiritual formation and social justice

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** How does the structure of Deuteronomy as a suzerain-vassal covenant both accommodate and subvert ancient Near Eastern political expectations?

2. **Application:** In what specific ways might modern communities implement the principle "remember that you were slaves in Egypt" when addressing contemporary social issues?

3. **Synthesis:** How do the concepts of "zakar" (remember) and "shakach" (forget) work together to create both individual spiritual formation and community social responsibility?

4. **Evaluation:** Why might the text emphasize Moses's intimate relationship with God rather than his achievement of entering the Promised Land, and what does this suggest about biblical definitions of success?

5. **Reflection:** How does the recurring connection between remembering one's own vulnerability and caring for currently vulnerable people challenge or support your understanding of social responsibility?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This episode powerfully demonstrates how personal spiritual formation and social justice are inseparably connected in biblical thinking. The constant call to "remember that you were slaves in Egypt" isn't just about historical awareness—it's about maintaining the kind of heart that notices and cares for those who are currently in vulnerable positions. The text suggests that when we forget our own stories of rescue, redemption, and divine care, we naturally begin to ignore those who need rescue, redemption, and care today.

What strikes me most is how remembering is presented as an active spiritual discipline rather than passive nostalgia. It requires intentional storytelling, community engagement, and practical systems that center the vulnerable rather than marginalize them. The episode challenges the modern tendency to separate personal piety from social responsibility, showing how biblical faith necessarily involves both intimate relationship with God and concrete care for others. The image of Moses dying by "the mouth of the Lord" while having lived "face to face" with God provides a beautiful picture of what ultimate success looks like—not the achievement of personal goals, but the depth of divine relationship that transforms how we live and love.

### BEMA Episode 31: Remember Where You Came From - Study Notes (2017)

#### Title & Source Summary
This episode focuses on the book of Deuteronomy as Moses' final teaching to Israel before entering the Promised Land. Marty Solomon and Brent Billings explore the central theme of remembering one's origins and how this memory shapes treatment of marginalized people - specifically the alien, orphan, and widow.

#### Key Takeaways

- Moses had an incredibly intimate relationship with God, described as knowing God "face to face" - a Hebrew expression that implies the intimacy of a kiss between lovers
- Deuteronomy contains 23 references to "remember" (zakar) and "do not forget" (shakach), emphasizing the critical importance of remembering one's story
- The phrase "remember you were slaves in Egypt" appears repeatedly as justification for treating marginalized people with compassion
- When we forget where we came from, we stop caring for those who are currently in positions we once occupied
- America, as a nation of immigrants, has lessons to learn from Israel's call to remember their immigrant/slave origins
- Deuteronomy follows the structure of ancient Suzerain-vassal covenants, showing it was written as a formal covenant document
- The entire Torah (Five Books of Moses) can be viewed as one complete covenant structure

#### Main Concepts & Theories

**The Hebrew Expression "Face to Face" (panim el panim)**
Moses' relationship with God is described using language typically reserved for intimate marital relationships. The Hebrew expression suggests physical closeness similar to lovers kissing, indicating an unprecedented level of intimacy between Moses and the Creator.

**The Cycle of Remembrance and Care**
Deuteronomy establishes a spiritual cycle: when we remember where we came from, we notice the marginalized (alien, orphan, widow). When we care for the marginalized, we are reminded of our own origins. This creates a positive feedback loop that keeps believers connected to both their past and their mission.

**Ancient Covenant Structure**
Deuteronomy follows the five-part structure of ancient Near Eastern covenants:
1. Preamble (Chapter 1A)
2. Historical Summary (Chapters 1-4)
3. Laws/Demands (Chapters 5-26)
4. Rewards/Punishments (Chapter 28)
5. Conclusion/Song (Chapter 32)

**The Marginalized Trinity: Alien, Orphan, Widow**
These three groups represent people pushed to society's edges - those without land rights, family protection, or social standing. They parallel Israel's experience as slaves in Egypt, making care for them a test of whether Israel remembers their story.

#### Examples & Applications

**Modern Immigration Parallels**
Just as Israel was commanded to remember their experience as aliens in Egypt, modern nations built by immigrants (like America) should consider how their origins inform their treatment of current immigrants and refugees.

**Harvest Laws as Social Justice**
Deuteronomy's agricultural laws required leaving corners of fields unharvested and not going back for forgotten sheaves. This wasn't charity but justice - a structural system ensuring food security for the vulnerable based on remembering shared humanity.

**Festival Inclusion**
Israel's religious celebrations were required to include foreigners, orphans, and widows. This ensured that moments of national joy weren't exclusive to the economically advantaged but reflected the inclusive character God desired.

**Economic Generosity Systems**
The tithe every third year was specifically designated for Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows - creating a systematic approach to economic justice rather than leaving it to individual charitable impulses.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Study the specific Hebrew words zakar (remember) and shakach (forget) to understand their full semantic range
- Examine how Jesus' ministry specifically embodied care for modern equivalents of the alien, orphan, and widow
- Research ancient Near Eastern covenant structures to better understand biblical literature
- Investigate the prophetic books (especially Isaiah) to see how they call Israel back to Deuteronomy's themes
- Explore the theological implications of describing God-human relationship in marital/intimate terms
- Study the Song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32) and its role in Jewish liturgical tradition
- Examine how early Christian communities applied these principles in their treatment of marginalized people
- Research Sandra Richter's "Epic of Eden" for deeper understanding of Suzerain-vassal covenants

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does the Hebrew expression for Moses knowing God "face to face" challenge typical Western understanding of divine-human relationships?

2. What is the significance of the repeated phrase "remember you were slaves in Egypt" in relation to specific laws about treating marginalized people?

3. How does the five-part structure of ancient covenants help us understand both Deuteronomy specifically and the Torah as a whole?

4. What modern parallels can you draw between Israel's experience as slaves/aliens in Egypt and contemporary refugee or immigrant experiences?

5. According to this episode, what happens spiritually and socially when a people "forget where they came from," and how might this apply to modern nations or communities?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This episode presents Deuteronomy not just as a legal code but as Moses' passionate final plea for Israel to maintain their identity through active remembrance. The central insight is that memory isn't just about the past - it's about present character and future mission. When we forget our own experiences of vulnerability, marginalization, or rescue, we lose our capacity to recognize and respond to those same conditions in others. The "alien, orphan, and widow" become litmus tests for whether we truly remember our story. This creates a powerful framework for thinking about how personal and national narratives should inform contemporary ethics, particularly around immigration, economic justice, and care for society's most vulnerable members.

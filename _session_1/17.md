- We have gone over the preface, the introduction and now we are entering into the narative.
- We are taking a break from the text this episode to take a step back and look at Egypt to understand what empire is and how it impacts culture and its people.
- Hagah project: What is going on in Exodus 4:24-31?
  - Why does God show up to kill Moses?
  - How does Zipporah know exactly what to do?
  - Why is Moses's son not carrying the sign of the covenant?
  - What has been Moses's experience in this story?
  - What kinds of things stand out about this story?
- Moses's experience as a Hebrew growing up in Pharoah's house.
  - Survivor's guilt--he was supposed to have been killed with the other babies.
  - He knows that he's a Hebrew because he bears the sign of the covenant.
  - Did he bear a grudge against the Egyptians because of the way they treated his people.
- Exodus 4:10
  - Moses argues with G-d about his speech impediment.
  - Marty argues that it's unlikely that any form of speech impediment would have been trained out of him having been raised in the most powerful house in the world.
  - G-d's shows anger toward Moses when it becomes apparent that his own son was not circumcized.
  - This seems to be another sign that Moses doesn't see himself as a member of G-d's people.
- Exodus 6
  - G-d tells Moses to go speak to Pharoah and Moses again pushes back.
    - 6:12 "...since I speak with faltering lips?" which is translated from the Hebrew as "I am uncircumsized of lips."
    - This seems to suggest Moses is still struggling with this issue of circumcision from earlier in his story with his son.
    - This same language is used in 6:30.
    - What we see is a ~chiasm.
      - A: 6:12 "faltering lips"
        - B: Geneology proving that Moses is the Hebrew he struggles to believe that he is.
      - 'A: 6:30 "faltering lips"
    - G-d never argues with Moses about his insecurities. G-d meets Moses where he is at in his insecurities.
      - Godâ€™s not interested in your qualifications. God is interested in your availability. God is interested in your trust.
- Brent notices 
  - throughout the story that G-d will instruct Moses and Moses will have no response in the text.
  - it's weird that G-d would want to kill Moses.
  - it's weird that Zapporah touched his feet with his son's foreskin.

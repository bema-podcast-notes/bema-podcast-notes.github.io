### BEMA Episode 13: Grappling with God, Part 1 - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 13: Grappling with God, Part 1 (E13v24)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon, Brent Billings, and guest Reed Dent  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 25-31  
**Topic:** An introduction to the life and character of Jacob, the third patriarch, examining his complex nature, struggles with his brother Esau, deceptive practices, and God's persistent grace despite Jacob's flaws.

#### Key Takeaways

- Jacob's name means "heel grasper," "supplanter," or "overreacher" - not necessarily "deceiver" as commonly taught
- The birthright (bechor) represents both material inheritance and spiritual responsibility to carry on the family's covenant with God
- Jacob demonstrates "chutzpah" (audacious determination) and fire for God's calling, unlike Esau who "despises" his birthright
- God shows "stupidly gracious" responses to Jacob despite his deceptive actions and character flaws
- Jacob's life is characterized by unsustainable relationships and chaotic circumstances due to his methods
- God often chooses passionate but flawed individuals over those who are rule-followers but lack fire
- Words carry covenantal power - Isaac cannot simply "take back" his blessing once spoken
- Holy experiences can happen in the most mundane, "middle of nowhere" places

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Birthright (Bechor) System

The Hebrew word "bechor" technically means "chosen" but culturally refers to the firstborn son in a patrilineal society. This system involved:

- **Double portion inheritance:** If a father had four sons, the estate was divided into five portions, with the bechor receiving two
- **Double responsibility:** The firstborn carried the weight of continuing the father's legacy, values, and covenant with God
- **Generational mission:** Each bechor was responsible for passing down the divine calling from Abraham through Isaac to the next generation

##### The Power of Spoken Words

Ancient Hebrew culture understood words as having efficacious, covenantal power:

- **Binding reality:** Once spoken with intention, blessings and vows created new realities that couldn't be easily undone
- **Cosmic effectiveness:** Isaac couldn't simply reverse his blessing because words "go to work" in the cosmos
- **Contractual nature:** Similar to marriage vows or promises to children - they create lasting obligations and relationships

##### Jacob's Character Paradox

Jacob embodies contradictory qualities that create complexity:

- **The "overreacher":** Someone whose reach exceeds their grasp, always wanting more
- **Tahm (peaceful/content):** Initially described as even-tempered or mild, yet consistently demonstrates the opposite
- **Fire vs. method:** Possesses genuine desire for God's calling but pursues it through deceptive means
- **Tragic figure:** Well-intentioned but choosing wrong methods, leading to destructive consequences

##### God's Grace Toward the Flawed

The episode explores why God continues working with Jacob despite his character issues:

- **Passion over perfection:** God values those who desire His calling even if they're imperfect
- **Moving targets:** It's easier to redirect someone with momentum (Jacob) than to motivate someone without fire (Esau)
- **Prophetic choice:** Rebecca received prophecy that "the older will serve the younger," suggesting divine election beyond human merit

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Parallels to Jacob's "Overreaching"

- **Entrepreneurs and innovators:** People who refuse to accept the status quo and constantly push boundaries
- **Activists and reformers:** Those who see injustice and can't rest until it's addressed
- **Church planters and missionaries:** Individuals driven by vision even when methods are questionable

##### Unsustainable Relationship Patterns

Jacob's story demonstrates how deceptive methods create chaos:

- **Family dynamics:** Favoritism between parents (Isaac favoring Esau, Rebecca favoring Jacob)
- **Workplace conflicts:** The "deceive-off" with Laban mirrors modern workplace manipulation and politics
- **Community breakdown:** Unlike Isaac who brought peace to conflicts, Jacob leaves chaos in his wake

##### Holy Moments in Ordinary Places

Jacob's Bethel experience illustrates that:

- **Geographic insignificance:** "Middle of nowhere's nowhere" can become "house of God"
- **Divine presence:** God was already present before Jacob recognized it
- **Accessibility:** Profound spiritual encounters aren't limited to "holy" locations or perfect people

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Theological Questions

- **Divine sovereignty vs. human agency:** How do God's prophetic plans interact with human choices and deceptions?
- **Grace and consequences:** Why does God show grace while still allowing natural consequences to unfold?
- **Election and character:** What does Jacob's selection reveal about God's criteria for choosing people?

##### Character Development Studies

- **Rebecca's role:** Did she share God's prophecy with Isaac? What motivated her deceptive plan?
- **Isaac's awareness:** Was he truly deceived, or did he suspect Jacob's identity during the blessing?
- **Esau's perspective:** What factors led to his apparent disregard for spiritual inheritance?

##### Cultural and Historical Context

- **Ancient Near Eastern birthrights:** How did surrounding cultures handle inheritance and family succession?
- **Covenant theology:** How does Jacob's story fit into the broader Abrahamic covenant narrative?
- **Patriarchal family dynamics:** What can we learn about ancient family structures and relationships?

##### Literary and Narrative Analysis

- **Foreshadowing:** How does Jacob's heel-grasping at birth predict his later wrestling with God?
- **Chiastic structures:** What literary patterns emerge in the Jacob narrative?
- **Character foils:** How do Jacob and Esau function as contrasting figures throughout the story?

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Compare and contrast Jacob and Esau's attitudes toward the birthright.** What does this reveal about their respective values and priorities?

2. **Analyze the role of deception in Jacob's story.** How do the various deceptions (birthright trade, blessing theft, Laban's tricks) create a pattern of consequences?

3. **Evaluate God's response to Jacob at Bethel.** Why might God show such grace to someone who has just committed significant deception?

4. **Examine the concept of "unsustainable relationships" in Jacob's life.** Provide specific examples and explain how his methods create chaos.

5. **Discuss the tension between divine election and human character.** How do we reconcile God's choice of Jacob with his obvious moral failings?

#### Personal Reflection Summary

Jacob's story challenges simple categories of good and bad, presenting instead a complex figure whose passionate desire for God's calling is undermined by questionable methods. The narrative reveals God's persistent grace toward flawed individuals who demonstrate spiritual hunger, even when their execution is deeply problematic. This first part of Jacob's journey sets up fundamental questions about divine election, human responsibility, and the mysterious ways God works through imperfect people.

The episode emphasizes that God often prefers passionate but flawed individuals over those who are spiritually apathetic, even if the latter appear more morally upright. Jacob's "chutzpah" - his audacious determination to be part of God's plan - becomes more valuable than Esau's birthright privilege coupled with spiritual indifference. However, the story doesn't endorse Jacob's methods, as evidenced by the chaos and broken relationships that follow his deceptive practices.

The Bethel encounter stands as a pivotal moment, demonstrating that God's presence transcends both geographical locations and human worthiness. Jacob's recognition that "God was in this place and I didn't know it" speaks to the accessibility of divine encounter in the most ordinary circumstances of life. This grace-filled response to Jacob's recent deceptions sets the stage for his continued transformation, though that journey will prove long and difficult.

The narrative invites readers to examine their own spiritual hunger and methods, challenging both the complacent and the driven to consider how God might work through their imperfections while calling them toward greater integrity and trust.

### BEMA Episode 13: Grappling with God, Part 1 - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 13 - Grappling with God, Part 1 (2017)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 25-31  
**Topic:** An examination of Jacob's early life, character, and God's choice to work through flawed but passionate individuals

This episode begins a deep dive into the life of Jacob, the third patriarch, exploring why God chose to work through such a complex and morally ambiguous figure. The discussion covers Jacob's birth, his acquisition of Esau's birthright and blessing, his time with Laban, and the theological implications of God using imperfect people.

#### Key Takeaways

- God often chooses passionate but flawed individuals over those who appear more qualified but lack commitment
- The Hebrew concept of *bechor* (firstborn) carries both privilege and responsibility in ancient patriarchal culture
- Words carry inherent power in Eastern Hebrew culture, unlike Western views that see words as empty vessels
- Jacob's deceptive methods, while problematic, demonstrate his deep desire for God's promises
- The story reveals that God can "steer a moving target" more easily than motivate the apathetic
- Jacob's encounter with Laban shows him meeting his match in cunning and deception
- Even dysfunctional family dynamics can be part of God's larger redemptive plan

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The *Bechor* (Firstborn) System

In ancient patriarchal culture, the firstborn son held special significance:

- **Inheritance:** Received a double portion of the father's estate (if three sons exist, estate split four ways with *bechor* getting two shares)
- **Responsibility:** Primary carrier of the father's legacy, mission, and values
- **Honor:** Considered a privilege and honor, not merely an obligation
- **Continuity:** Ensured the continuation of family name and covenant promises

##### Eastern vs. Western Views of Words

The episode highlights a crucial cultural difference:

- **Western Perspective:** "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me" - words are empty conduits, with power residing in truth
- **Eastern Hebrew Perspective:** Words carry inherent power (referencing Genesis 1 where God spoke creation into existence)
- **Practical Implication:** Once Isaac's blessing was spoken, it couldn't be retracted - the words were "efficacious" and would accomplish their purpose

##### The Jacob vs. Esau Dynamic

Two contrasting personalities represent different approaches to God's calling:

- **Esau:** The "safe choice" - strong, skilled hunter, plays by rules, appears qualified but lacks passion for spiritual inheritance
- **Jacob:** The "risky choice" - deceptive, manipulative, but possesses burning desire (*chutzpah*) for God's promises
- **Divine Preference:** God chooses passionate imperfection over apathetic competence

##### The Laban Encounters

Jacob's time with Laban (Genesis 29-31) reveals:

- **Mirror Character:** Laban matches Jacob's cunning, showing Jacob his own reflection
- **Divine Justice:** Jacob experiences being deceived after being a deceiver
- **Cultural Tension:** The idolatry in Nahor's family line contrasts with Abraham's monotheism
- **Unreconciled Reconciliation:** Their final covenant reveals deep, unresolved tensions

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Context Examples

- **Birthright Trading:** Esau's casual attitude toward his inheritance would have been shocking in ancient culture, like a modern heir to a family business saying "whatever" about their responsibilities
- **Blessing Ceremony:** Isaac's inability to retract his blessing parallels ancient legal documents - once sealed and witnessed, they carried permanent authority
- **Marriage Customs:** Laban's insistence that older daughters marry first reflects documented ancient Near Eastern practices

##### Modern Applications

- **Leadership Selection:** Organizations often choose passionate but flawed individuals over technically qualified but uncommitted candidates
- **Personal Growth:** People with intense drive, even misdirected, often achieve more transformation than those who are passive
- **Words and Commitment:** Understanding the power of spoken commitments and promises in relationships and agreements

##### Character Development Parallels

- **Joseph's Story:** The episode notes similarities between Jacob and Joseph, including supernatural elements and divination tools
- **Family Dysfunction:** Even Abraham's family line shows patterns of deception and favoritism across generations
- **God's Patience:** The narrative demonstrates God's long-term perspective in developing character through circumstances

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Theological Questions

- How does divine sovereignty interact with human free will in Jacob's story?
- What does Jacob's selection reveal about God's character and values?
- How do we reconcile God's use of deception in achieving His purposes?

##### Cultural Studies

- Ancient Near Eastern marriage customs and family structures
- The role of dreams and divine communication in Hebrew culture
- Comparison of Mesopotamian and Canaanite religious practices

##### Character Development

- The psychology of sibling rivalry and parental favoritism
- How trauma and family dysfunction shape spiritual development
- The difference between godly ambition and selfish manipulation

##### Literary Analysis

- The use of wordplay and names in Hebrew narrative
- Symbolic elements (ladders, stones, meals) in the Jacob cycle
- The structure and pacing of biblical storytelling

##### Practical Theology

- How modern believers can channel spiritual passion constructively
- Dealing with personal moral failures while pursuing God's calling
- Understanding God's patience with character development over time

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** What specific qualities made Jacob appealing to God despite his obvious character flaws, and how does this challenge conventional ideas about spiritual qualification?

2. **Cultural Context:** How did the ancient Hebrew understanding of word-power differ from modern Western perspectives, and why couldn't Isaac simply retract his blessing once given?

3. **Character Development:** In what ways did Jacob's encounter with Laban serve as divine discipline, and what does this suggest about God's methods of character formation?

4. **Theological Reflection:** What does God's choice of Jacob over Esau reveal about divine values and priorities, particularly regarding passion versus moral correctness?

5. **Application:** How might the principle of God preferring "moving targets" over apathetic individuals apply to modern discipleship and spiritual growth?

#### Personal Summary

This episode challenges comfortable assumptions about spiritual qualification and God's selection criteria. Rather than choosing the obviously righteous Esau, God selects the passionate but flawed Jacob, suggesting that spiritual hunger and drive may be more valuable to God than moral perfection. The study reveals how God can work through broken family dynamics, use even deceptive circumstances for His purposes, and patiently develop character over time.

The cultural insights about Eastern views of word-power and the *bechor* system illuminate why the birthright and blessing carried such weight in the narrative. Jacob's time with Laban serves as both consequence for his deception and preparation for his future role as Israel. Most encouragingly, the episode suggests that those who recognize themselves as "Jacobs" - passionate but flawed - can take hope that God desires to channel their intensity for His kingdom purposes, even while addressing their problematic methods.

The ongoing nature of Jacob's story (this being only Part 1) reminds us that spiritual formation is a process, and that God's patience with our development mirrors His patience with the patriarchs. The episode ultimately presents a God who values authentic spiritual hunger over superficial righteousness, offering hope to all who struggle with imperfection while pursuing divine calling.

### Original Notes

- [Genesis 25](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.25.NIV)-[31](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.31.NIV)
- Marty's knowledge of Ya'akov has been greatly influenced by Rabbi David Fohrman
- Marty struggles with the tough parts of Ya'akov and how he becomes the father of G-d's people.
- [Genesis 25:19-34](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.25.19-34.NIV)
  - Birthrights: Firstborn would be known as the behor and the behor gets a double portion
    - If a father as two sons, the estate would be split three ways and the behor would get two of the three portions, three sons, four ways, etc.
      - The behor no only gets a double portion of wealth but also a double portion of responsibility.
    - 'Esav comes out first and so he gets the birthright.
      - 'Esav is the man's man Yitz’chak prefers 'Esav.
      - Ya'akov preferred to stay at home and was a momma's boy.
      - Even though it was typically an honor to be the behor, 'Esav despised his birthright and wanted nothing to do with it.
      - Ya'akov, though, wanted the birthright deeply.
- [Genesis 27](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.27.NIV)
  - Yitz'chak is old and blind and Rivkah sends Ya'akov in to get 'Esav's blessing while he is away.
    - Does Rivkah do this because she's like Ya'akov or because she was told by G-d that the younger would serve the other? Did she ever even tell Yitz'chak what G-d revealed to her? Does he know and push back or is it kept a secret?
      - Does it show a lot of faith and trust in the story to believe what G-d told her and make it happen especially knowing the kind of individual Ya'akov is at the time.
    - Yitz'chak would have deliberately crafted two different blessings for each of his boys that he believe were given to him by G-d about the his boys and how their lives would go.
      - Sticks and stone... but to Eastern Jews, words are power. Once these words leave his mouth, he cannot just take them back.
      - Once the mistake has been made, 'Esav weeped bitterly knowing he had lost the blessing Yitz'chak has spent considerable effort crafting for 'Esav to Ya'akov as well.
- [Genesis 28](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.28.NIV)
  - Ya'akov leaves town after taking the blessing and heads to Nahor.
    - On his way to meet Laban, the grandson of Nahor, he has a dream at Bethel of angels ascending and descending a ladder.
      - Bethel is effectively "nowhere significant". When Ya'akov wakes from his dream he realizes that G-d is everywhere--even in the places where we do not think he is.
- [Genesis 29](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.29.NIV)
  - Ya'akov meets Laban who has two sisters, Leah (whose name means "Tired Eyes" meaning she wasn't very attractive) and Rachel who Ya'akov finds incredibly attractive.
    - Ya'akov meets his match in Laban. "Culture dictates the older daughter is married off first" and so Laban tricks Ya'akov into marrying Leah first and Rachel second.
    - There comes a competition between the two to see who can usurp who best.
- [Genesis 31](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/GEN.31.NIV)
  - Ya'akov plans to leave knowing Laban doesn't have anything to give him and his wives and suggests that Laban give him half of his flock. There then appears to be some intervention from G-d in this story with the flocks.
    - When they do leave, Rachel secretly takes one of Laban's idols and hides it under her cushion, and to find a way out of this confrontation, they had a meal together.
    - This kind of meal is a reconcilliatory meal.
    - There is still clearly disagreement between the two as they cannot even agree on what to call the place.
    - "And Laban said..." implies that Ya'akov is listening and not responding.
    - Ya'akov creates a pillar and the two argue about the god to whom they make their oath and the name of the place, etc.
  - It seems that G-d likes to choose people that the people wouldn't typically choose.
    - It also seems that G-d prefers those that have a fire in their belly over those that are more apathetic. The Ya'akovs over the 'Esavs.

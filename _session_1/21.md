### BEMA Episode 21 Study Notes: With All Your Soul & "Very"

#### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Episode 21: "With All Your Soul & 'Very'"** explores the second and third tests that the Israelites faced on their journey to Mount Sinai. This episode focuses on the Hebrew concepts of *nephesh* (soul) and *meod* (very/might), examining how God tested His people's commitment through trials involving water at Massah and Meribah, and the battle against the Amalekites. The episode reveals how these tests connect to the foundational prayer known as the Shema.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Israelites underwent three tests on their way to Mount Sinai: heart (*vav*), soul (*nephesh*), and very/might (*meod*)
- The test of the soul involved demanding proof from God rather than trusting His provision
- Testing God differs fundamentally from asking God for help in belief (as Gideon did)
- God's response to testing demonstrates His character of grace - He takes the blow on behalf of His people
- The test of *meod* (very/might) reveals how we use our resources to protect the vulnerable
- All three tests ultimately examine how the community treats those who cannot care for themselves
- The Shema prayer encompasses loving God with heart, soul, and might, plus loving neighbor as yourself

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Nature of Nephesh (Soul)

*Nephesh* represents the entirety of a person's being - not just spirit, but the complete integration of body, spirit, emotions, intellect, and consciousness. It encompasses everything that makes "you" you, including both physical and transcendent aspects of personhood.

##### Testing God vs. Seeking God's Help

The episode distinguishes between two types of interaction with God:

- **Testing God**: Making demands with ultimatums ("God, you don't get me unless you do X")
- **Seeking Help**: Asking for reassurance in genuine struggle with belief (like Gideon's fleece)

The Israelites crossed into dangerous territory by demanding God prove Himself repeatedly rather than trusting His demonstrated faithfulness.

##### The Symbolism of Striking the Rock

When God commanded Moses to strike (*nakah* - to smite/kill) the rock at Horeb with God standing between Moses and the mountain, it created a powerful visual metaphor. The elders witnessed what appeared to be Moses striking God Himself, demonstrating God's willingness to take the blow on behalf of His people - foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.

##### Meod and Community Resource Usage

*Meod* (very/might) refers to one's resources, strength, and capabilities. The test of *meod* during the Amalekite attack revealed whether the Israelites would use their strength to protect the vulnerable (those traditionally attacked by Amalekites - the sick, weak, and slow at the back of the group).

##### Banners and Divine Direction

Moses' staff raised as a banner (*Adonai Nissi* - "The Lord is My Banner") served not as magic but as a directional marker. Ancient banners pointed to what lay behind them - typically temples and gods. Moses' raised staff reminded the fighters that their true strength came from God who stood behind the banner.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Community Structure

The episode contrasts two community models:

- **Empire communities**: Place weak and marginalized on fringes or bottom, building on their backs
- **Shalom communities**: Circle wagons around vulnerable members, placing them in protective center

##### Resource Usage in Crisis

The Gideon parallel illustrates choosing people who think of others even in personal need - soldiers who cupped water in hands to drink quickly and make way for others, showing concern for community welfare over personal comfort.

##### Contemporary Testing of God

Modern believers may unconsciously test God by setting conditions: "I'll follow God if He provides X" or "God gets my commitment only when He meets my demands." This differs from honest prayers for strength in doubt or guidance in difficult circumstances.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- The full traditional Shema prayer and its components from Deuteronomy and Numbers
- The historical and geographical context of the Sinai Peninsula and its rock formations
- The role of the tribe of Dan as rear guard in protecting vulnerable community members
- Connections between these tests and Jesus' teachings about the two greatest commandments
- The relationship between individual faith tests and community formation
- Ancient Near Eastern banner symbolism and its theological significance

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How does the Hebrew understanding of *nephesh* (soul) differ from modern Western concepts of soul, and why is this distinction important for understanding the second test?**

2. **What specific evidence from Psalm 78 reveals the Israelites' attitude during their wilderness testing, and how does this commentary enhance our understanding of the Exodus narrative?**

3. **Explain the symbolic significance of God standing between Moses and the rock during the water miracle, and how this event prefigures themes found throughout Scripture.**

4. **How do the three tests (heart, soul, very) collectively reveal God's priorities for community formation, particularly regarding treatment of vulnerable members?**

5. **In what ways does the concept of *Adonai Nissi* (The Lord is My Banner) function both practically and theologically during the battle against the Amalekites?**

#### Personal Summary

Episode 21 reveals that God's testing of His people centers not on individual spiritual performance but on community character - specifically how they treat those who cannot care for themselves. The progression from heart to soul to might demonstrates increasing levels of commitment, moving from internal trust to total life surrender to active resource deployment for others' benefit. The Israelites' failures in these tests don't result in divine abandonment but in divine grace, as seen when God literally places Himself in harm's way during the rock-striking incident. This pattern establishes that authentic love for God inevitably manifests as sacrificial care for neighbors, making the later formulation of the two greatest commandments a natural outflow of these wilderness lessons. The tests ultimately prepare God's people not just for Mount Sinai's revelation but for their calling as a community that embodies divine *shalom* by protecting rather than exploiting the vulnerable.

### BEMA Episode 21: With All Your Soul & "Very" - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 21: With All Your Soul & "Very" (2017)  
**Topic:** God's three tests of the Israelites on their journey to Mount Sinai - focusing on the tests of the soul (nephesh) and might (meod) through the manna provision and the battle with Amalek.

#### Key Takeaways

- God tests His people not to watch them fail, but to experience (yada) what is in their hearts and to teach them how to trust Him
- The three tests examine different aspects of devotion: heart (levav), soul (nephesh), and might/very (meod)
- The manna test reveals God's provision and teaches community care for the weak and marginalized
- The water from the rock demonstrates God's willingness to take judgment upon Himself for His people
- The battle with Amalek shows the importance of using all resources in service to God and community
- God's character remains consistent from Genesis through the New Testament - He always provides the sacrifice

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tale of Two Kingdoms Framework

- **Empire:** Built on fear, coercion, and the "upraised stick" of Pharaoh enforcing his will
- **Shalom:** Based on trust, invitation, and God's "shepherd stick" leading with His voice
- The Israelites are learning to transition from Empire thinking to Shalom living

##### The Three Tests of Deuteronomy 8

God tests His people in three areas to "yada" (experience/know) what is in their hearts:

1. **Heart (Levav) - Test of the Will** (Marah - bitter waters)
   - Will you trust God's word and wait for His provision?
   - Will you choose voluntary obedience?

2. **Soul (Nephesh) - Test of Your Being** (Manna and water from rock)
   - Your essence, the "you" that makes you who you are
   - Will you give your whole self to God or demand He prove Himself?
   - Putting God to the test = refusing to give Him your soul

3. **Might/Very (Meod) - Test of Resources** (Battle with Amalek)
   - All your talents, time, strength, and everything you can produce
   - Will you use all your resources for God's purposes?
   - From Genesis 1:31 - "tov meod" (very good) - your "very" everything

##### Hebrew Word Studies

- **Yada:** To know experientially, not just intellectually
- **Levav:** Heart - the seat of will and voluntary worship
- **Nephesh:** Soul - the essence of who you are as a being
- **Meod:** "Very" - all your resources, talents, and capabilities
- **Manna:** "What is it?" - God's mysterious provision
- **Tsa'aq:** Moses' cry of literal fear for his life
- **Nakah:** To strike to kill
- **Paniym:** God standing "before" (between Moses and the rock)
- **Nissi:** Banner/flag pointing to what lies beyond

#### Examples & Applications

##### The Manna Miracle - Community Care

The rabbis teach that when "some gathered much and some little," it wasn't about hoarding vs. trusting, but about community members gathering for those who couldn't:

- The sick, elderly, and disabled who couldn't gather for themselves
- The community ensured everyone had exactly what they needed
- This demonstrates the law and statute of caring for the marginalized

##### God Taking the Strike

When God tells Moses to strike the rock at Horeb:

- God positions Himself between Moses and the rock (paniym)
- Moses must "strike to kill" (nakah) - the same action he used against the Egyptian
- God says "Strike me instead of judging the people"
- This prefigures Jesus and echoes Genesis stories of God providing the sacrifice

##### Amalek's Cowardly Attack

The Amalekites attacked from behind, targeting the weak and weary:

- This violated justice and showed Empire thinking
- God later commands that the weak go in the middle for protection
- A community's obedience is measured by where they place the marginalized

##### Moses as Nissi (Banner)

Like Egyptian temple flags that pointed to where the god was:

- Moses holding up the staff pointed the people beyond himself to God
- The banner isn't the point - it points to what lies beyond
- "Adonai Nissi" - The Lord is my banner

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- The connection between the three tests and Jesus' temptations in the wilderness
- How the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-5) relates to these three tests
- The theological implications of God consistently providing the sacrifice throughout Scripture
- The practical application of prioritizing the marginalized in modern faith communities
- The difference between testing God versus being tested by God
- Old Testament typology pointing forward to Christ's sacrifice
- The role of community leadership in protecting the vulnerable (tribe of Dan as rear guard)

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** How do the three tests (heart, soul, might) progress in complexity and what does each reveal about the relationship between God and His people?

2. **Application:** According to the rabbinical interpretation, how does the manna miracle demonstrate proper community care, and what would this look like in a modern faith community?

3. **Comparison:** How does the "tale of two kingdoms" (Empire vs. Shalom) framework help explain the Israelites' struggles in the wilderness, and where do you see these competing narratives today?

4. **Interpretation:** What is the significance of God positioning Himself between Moses and the rock, and how does this action connect to the broader biblical narrative of God providing sacrifice?

5. **Synthesis:** How does the Hebrew word "meod" (very) from Genesis 1:31 and Deuteronomy 6:5 help us understand what it means to love God with all our "might," and what are the practical implications?

#### Personal Summary

This episode reveals that God's testing isn't about pass/fail grades but about relationship and growth. Through the three tests in the wilderness, we see a God who consistently provides, protects, and sacrifices for His people. The progression from heart (will) to soul (being) to might (resources) shows an increasing depth of surrender. Most powerfully, we see God's character remain constant - from Genesis through the cross, He is the one who provides the sacrifice and takes the judgment upon Himself. The community aspects of each test remind us that faith is not individualistic but involves caring for the most vulnerable among us. The challenge for us is whether we will choose Shalom over Empire in our own wilderness moments, trusting God's provision rather than demanding proof.

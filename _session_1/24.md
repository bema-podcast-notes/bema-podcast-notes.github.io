### BEMA Episode 24: Creating a Space - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Episode 24: Creating a Space (2025)**
This episode explores the concept of spiritual practices as a means of creating space for God in our lives, using the Tabernacle as a metaphor. The hosts discuss various spiritual disciplines that help believers develop intimacy with God and community with others, moving beyond traditional approaches to prayer and Bible study to embrace a broader spectrum of spiritual practices.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Tabernacle serves as a model for creating sacred space - God asks us to create space, and He will fill it
- Spiritual practices are not about religious performance but about developing authentic intimacy with God
- Success is defined as "developing intimacy with God and community with each other through a living relationship with Jesus"
- We should focus on a few sustainable practices rather than attempting to do everything at once
- Different seasons of life call for different spiritual disciplines
- Creating space for God requires intentionality in our busy, distracted culture

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tabernacle as Mobile Genesis

- The Tabernacle represents a "mobile Genesis 1, 2, and 3" - a portable Garden of Eden
- In creation, God created space and asked humanity to fill it; with the Tabernacle, God asks us to create space and He will fill it
- This reversal represents a fundamental shift in the divine-human relationship after the Fall

##### Impact Campus Ministries' Definition of Success

- "Success is developing intimacy with God and community with each other through a living relationship with Jesus"
- Individuals developing intimacy with God in Christian community will naturally make an impact for the kingdom
- Ministry should be the product of our love for God, not crowd out intimacy with God
- We cannot control impact or fruitful ministry, but we have absolute control over developing intimacy with God

##### Categories of Spiritual Practices

###### Prayer Practices

- **Prayer Journaling**: Documenting prayers to track God's work over time (like "spiritual flossing")
- **Fixed-Hour Prayer**: Setting alarms throughout the day (9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm) to pause and pray
- **Contemplative Prayer**: Including centering prayers like "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner"
- **Praying the Text**: Using Scripture (especially Psalms) as the foundation for prayer

###### Practices of Presence

- **Solitude, Sabbath, and Silence**: Creating space to become more aware of God's love and grace than life's demands
- **Practicing the Presence of God**: Learning to be constantly aware of God as companion throughout daily activities
- **Simplicity**: Resisting acquisition, complexity, consumption, and hurry through intentional pursuit of a simple life

###### Other Spiritual Disciplines

- **Generosity**: Seasons of intentional giving as a spiritual practice, not just charity
- **Submission**: Choosing to submit to leadership or circumstances as a means of spiritual formation
- **Gratitude**: The Jewish practice of saying 70 blessings per day as expressions of thankfulness
- **Meditating and Memorizing**: Focusing on Scripture passages and committing them to memory (without "stacking")
- **Spiritual Direction**: Formal relationships with trained spiritual companions
- **Seasonal Practices**: Including fasting, feasting, and following the church calendar

##### Key Insights on Fasting

- Fasting is not about becoming "more spiritual" but about being humbled and broken down
- We should fast in response to something (grief, need for humility) rather than to achieve something
- Fasting strips away pride and connects us to our humanity, making us more ready to hear God

#### Examples & Applications

##### Bill's Challenge Story

Marty's mentor Bill challenged him to sit by a lake for eight hours with just a Bible and lunch, only opening the Bible if God prompted him. This experience taught Marty the power of creating space for God and led to a life-changing realization about neglecting his wife.

##### Fixed-Hour Prayer in Practice

At Impact Campus Ministries conferences, staff set phone alarms for regular prayer times. When the alarm sounds during conversations or projects, it brings immediate perspective and awareness of God's presence.

##### Sabbath and Simplicity Integration

Josh describes how preparation for Sabbath meals can become overly complex, defeating the purpose of rest. The practice of simplicity informs how to approach Sabbath - enjoying good things without unnecessary stress.

##### Christian Reputation and Tipping

The hosts address the poor reputation Christians have as restaurant customers on Sundays, suggesting that generous tipping can be transformed from a transaction into a spiritual practice of generosity.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Jewish Spiritual Practices**: Deeper study of Shema, blessing practices, and Torah-based spiritual disciplines
- **Church Calendar Integration**: How Advent, Lent, and other liturgical seasons can shape spiritual formation
- **Community vs. Individual Practices**: Exploring spiritual disciplines that can be practiced in groups
- **Cultural Barriers to Spiritual Practice**: How modern culture of productivity and consumption interferes with spiritual formation
- **Spiritual Direction Training**: Understanding how to find and work with spiritual directors
- **Fasting Variations**: Different types of fasting (food, media, consumption) for various spiritual purposes

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How does the metaphor of the Tabernacle as "mobile Genesis" help us understand the purpose of spiritual practices in creating space for God?**

2. **What is the difference between Impact Campus Ministries' definition of success and typical ministry success metrics, and why is this distinction important?**

3. **Why do the hosts recommend choosing only a few spiritual practices at a time rather than attempting to implement many disciplines simultaneously?**

4. **According to the episode, what is the true purpose of fasting, and how does this differ from common misconceptions about fasting as a spiritual discipline?**

5. **How do the "practices of presence" (solitude, Sabbath, silence, practicing God's presence, and simplicity) work together to create space for experiencing God's love and companionship?**

#### Personal Summary

This episode presents a refreshing approach to spiritual formation that moves beyond checkbox Christianity to authentic relationship-building with God. The central metaphor of the Tabernacle as a space we create for God to fill provides a powerful framework for understanding spiritual practices. Rather than viewing disciplines as religious duties, the hosts present them as opportunities for intimacy with God and community with others.

The practical wisdom shared - particularly about starting small, choosing practices that fit different seasons of life, and understanding that some disciplines should challenge us while others bring life - makes spiritual formation accessible rather than overwhelming. The emphasis on God filling the space we create, rather than us trying to manufacture spiritual experiences, places the focus on God's grace and presence rather than human effort.

The episode's integration of Jewish practices with Christian spirituality enriches our understanding of biblical patterns of worship and prayer. Most importantly, the redefinition of success as developing intimacy with God rather than achieving measurable ministry outcomes provides a healthy foundation for sustainable spiritual growth and authentic community engagement.

### BEMA Episode 24: Creating a Space - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

BEMA Episode 24: "Creating a Space" explores the concept of spiritual disciplines as means of creating intentional space for God to work in our lives. Drawing from the story of the tabernacle as a "mobile Genesis 1," Marty Solomon teaches how ancient practices can transform modern spiritual life by helping believers create sacred spaces that God can fill with His presence.

#### Key Takeaways

- If we create the space for God, He will fill it - though not necessarily in the ways or timing we expect
- The tabernacle represents a reversal of Genesis 1: instead of God creating space for humans to fill, humans create space for God to fill
- Spiritual disciplines are practical tools for creating space, not ends in themselves
- Modern culture's busyness and anxiety often prevent us from experiencing God's presence
- Effective spiritual practice requires intentionality, patience, and willingness to slow down
- Multiple disciplines can be combined and customized to fit individual needs and circumstances
- The goal is not to master all practices but to consistently engage a few that create space for divine encounter

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tabernacle as Mobile Genesis 1

The tabernacle story represents a theological reversal of the creation narrative. In Genesis 1, God creates space and invites humanity to fill it ("be fruitful and multiply"). When humanity fails, God initiates a new pattern: humans create the space (the tabernacle), and God fills it with His presence. This establishes the principle that intentional space-making invites divine encounter.

##### The Two Kingdoms Narrative

Life exists in tension between two competing narratives:

- **Empire**: Characterized by fear, coercion, imperial power, wealth, security, and fame - operating with closed fists
- **Shalom**: Characterized by invitation, trust, and open hands - representing God's counter-narrative to worldly systems

##### Creating Space for God

The central principle that "if you create the space, God will fill it" operates on several levels:

- God may not fill the space in expected ways or timing
- God will not necessarily do what we want with the space
- The practice requires letting go of control over outcomes
- Space-creation counteracts cultural busyness and spiritual anxiety

##### Spiritual Disciplines as Space-Making Tools

Spiritual disciplines function not as legalistic requirements but as practical methods for creating sacred space. They work by:

- Slowing down mental and emotional activity
- Creating margin for divine encounter
- Training attention toward God's presence
- Developing spiritual awareness and sensitivity

#### Examples & Applications

##### Prayer Disciplines

- **Prayer Journaling**: Writing prayers and reflections to track God's work over time
- **Fixed-Hour Prayer**: Setting regular alarms (9am, noon, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm) for brief prayer moments
- **Contemplative Prayer**: Repetitive prayers like "Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner" that center the heart
- **Praying the Text**: Using Scripture, especially Psalms, as prayer content rather than creating original prayers

##### Presence Disciplines

- **Solitude, Sabbath, and Silence**: Extended times (4-8 hours) of quiet reflection, often in nature
- **Practicing the Presence of God**: Cultivating awareness of God's companionship in mundane activities like laundry or commuting
- **Simplicity**: Intentionally resisting complexity, acquisition, consumption, and hurry in areas like clothing, eating, transportation, and technology

##### Lifestyle Disciplines

- **Generosity and Secrecy**: Practicing giving without recognition, such as doubling tips or always saying "yes" to requests for help
- **Submission**: Choosing to follow leadership you disagree with (when not morally problematic) as spiritual training
- **Gratitude**: Attempting to offer 70 blessings daily, following Jewish tradition
- **Meditation and Memorization**: Learning Scripture by heart in weekly portions rather than attempting large blocks

##### Calendar and Seasonal Disciplines

- **Fasting**: Not primarily for receiving answers but for connecting with human brokenness and creating space for God's strength
- **Feasting and Celebration**: Knowing when to indulge and celebrate God's goodness
- **Liturgical Calendar**: Following patterns like Advent (descent into darkness) and Lent (preparation) leading to Easter celebration

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Historical and Theological Contexts

- Study of tabernacle construction parallels to Genesis 1 creation account
- Jewish prayer traditions and their application to Christian practice
- Monastic traditions and contemplative prayer development
- Desert Fathers and early Christian spiritual practices

##### Practical Implementation

- Developing personal rhythm combining multiple disciplines
- Adapting ancient practices to modern technological environments
- Creating community accountability for spiritual discipline practice
- Balancing structure with flexibility in spiritual practice

##### Psychological and Spiritual Formation

- Understanding how busyness affects spiritual receptivity
- Exploring the relationship between silence and divine encounter
- Investigating the role of physical practices in spiritual development
- Examining cultural barriers to contemplative practice

##### Biblical and Textual Studies

- Deeper study of Exodus tabernacle narratives
- Exploration of Jesus' practices of solitude and prayer
- Paul's teachings on spiritual discipline and training
- Old Testament examples of fasting, celebration, and seasonal observance

##### Contemporary Applications

- Addressing technology addiction through simplicity practices
- Developing sustainable spiritual rhythms for busy professionals
- Creating family and community practices around spiritual disciplines
- Integrating environmental and social justice concerns with spiritual practice

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis**: How does the concept of the tabernacle as "mobile Genesis 1" change your understanding of the relationship between human initiative and divine response in spiritual practice?

2. **Application**: Marty mentions that it took him 4-5 hours of solitude before his mind truly slowed down. What does this suggest about the depth of commitment required for effective spiritual practice in our current cultural context?

3. **Evaluation**: Compare and contrast the "empire" and "shalom" narratives described in the episode. How do spiritual disciplines specifically counteract the empire narrative in practical ways?

4. **Synthesis**: How might you combine 2-3 of the spiritual disciplines mentioned to create a personalized approach to "creating space" that fits your current life circumstances?

5. **Critical Thinking**: Marty states his belief that "if you create the space, God will fill it" while acknowledging this isn't directly stated in Scripture. How do you evaluate the validity of principles derived from biblical patterns rather than explicit commands?

#### Personal Summary

Episode 24 presents spiritual disciplines not as religious obligations but as practical tools for creating space where God can work. The core insight that humans must create space for God to fill represents a profound shift from expecting God to break through our busyness to taking responsibility for cultivating receptivity.

The episode's strength lies in its practical approach, offering concrete practices while emphasizing that the goal is not mastery of all disciplines but consistent engagement with a few that create genuine space for divine encounter. Marty's personal stories, particularly his eight-hour lake experience and his mentor Bill's influence, demonstrate the transformative power of sustained commitment to space-making practices.

The teaching challenges contemporary Christian culture's tendency to limit spiritual practice to Bible study and prayer, offering a rich menu of historically-grounded disciplines. The emphasis on patience, process, and letting go of control over outcomes provides a healthy corrective to results-oriented approaches to spirituality.

Most significantly, the episode positions spiritual disciplines within the larger narrative tension between empire and shalom, making clear that these practices are not merely personal enrichment tools but ways of participating in God's counter-narrative to worldly systems of fear and coercion.

### Original Notes

### Review

- G-d gives us a new narrative.
  - He finds a new family in the person of Avraham.
  - The narrative of G-d begins in Exodus.
    - There are two kingdoms that oppose each other, Empire and Shalom.
      - Empire is a narrative of fear, coercion, a particular kind of imperial power, wealth, security, fame.
      - Shalom is a narrative of invitation, trust, open hands rather than closed fists, a narrative that runs counter to what the world offers us.

### The Tabernacle

- Filling spaces
  - Lesson's from Ray
    - In the creation story, G-d created a space and told man to fill it when he said to "be fruitful and multiply" which did not work out so well.
    - In the retelling of creation with the Tabernacle, G-d says I want YOU to create the space and I'll fill it.
  - Marty took from Ray's lesson, "If you create the space, G-d will fill it." This is not directly from scripture but is one that Marty believes.
    - He may not fill the space in the way that we would like him to fill it, but he will fill the space nonetheless.
    - Re: when G-d feels distant, "If we're not going to create a space for G-d, I don't know how in the world we can be upset when G-d doesn't fill our lives."

### Spiritual Disciplines

[[Timestamp]](https://www.bemadiscipleship.com/24?t=438)

- One of the ways we create space is with the practice of Spiritual Disciplines.
  - Mentors
    - Steve: Taught Marty how to love people in deeply impactful ways.
    - Bill Westfall: The President of Impact Ministries before Marty.
      - Bill was spiritually present where ever he was at and Marty was too busy to pick up on this.
      - Bill once said to Marty, "I had a challenge for you but you know... nevermind. I don't think it's for you."
        - This caught Marty's attention and Bill challenged Marty to take a sack lunch to a lake and sit in silence for 8 hours.
        - It wasn't until about the 5 or 6 hour mark that Marty was able to actually empty his mind of the busyness and settle his mind.
  - "[Impact Ministries] pursue G-d by pursing the spiritual practices."
- When we think about the Tabernacle and the fact that G-d's people created a space and then G-d filled it, we can do the same thing in our lives and G-d gets to fill it.
  - We talk about two spiritual disciplines more than anything else in our culture, **Bible Study** and **Prayer**.
  - Both of these practices are incredibly important but we often stop there.
  - While the goal is not to do every single one of these, here is a list of additional spiritual disciplines.

#### Prayer Disciplines

[[Timestamp]](https://www.bemadiscipleship.com/24?t=1024)

- **Prayer Journaling:** Keeping a journal of prayers. Sometimes people get hung up on the language. The point is to see what G-d is doing in your life over the course of time, especially during certain seasons of life.
- **Fixed Hour Prayer:** An alarm goes off at a specific time every day, or on an interval throughout the day, and when that time comes, or that alarm goes off, one stops for 30 seconds to recite the Lord's Prayer.
- **Contemplative Prayer:** There is a mystic hiding in some people.
  - One of the most famous contemplative prayers would be the Jesus Centering Prayer, "Jesus Christ, Son of G-d, have mercy on me, a sinner."
  - After a while, centering prayers begin to speak back to you.
  - This form of prayer is great for getting your heart right before an event that requires it.
  - Marty says the same blessing after every breakfast because the prayer beings to speak back to him.
- **Praying the Text:** Many Jewish prayers come straight out of the Text. The Jewish tradition can teach us that G-d has already spoken and we don't always have to create something new to pray.

#### Disciplines of Presence

- **Solitude, Sabbath, and Silence:**
  - This is what Bill was teaching Marty: "Creating a space to become more aware of the love, grace, and companionship of G-d than the companionship, demands, and duties of life and others."
  - Creating a space of solitude in silence to let go of the busyness and hear from G-d.
    - There is an image of a person holding on to a handful of balloons and slowly letting go of one balloon at a time until the person is left with a single, solitary balloon that G-d wants them to hang on to.
- **Practicing the Presence of God:** Learning to become aware of G-d as a constant companion. When we are doing the laundry and shoveling snow, can become spiritual work when we acknowledge and become fully aware of G-d's presence.
  - [*The Practice of the Presence of God* by Brother Lawrence](https://amzn.to/2nfl2h5)
    - This is not a modern book and will be a little different to read that we are used to.
- **Simplicity:** Resisting the pull of complexity, acquisition, consumption and hurry through the intentional pursuit of a simple life.
  - Examples of this is Lent, transportation, technology, food, etc. It's creating a space for G-d to fill and to work.

#### Lifestyle Disciplines

- **Generosity and Secrecy:** Sometimes these go together and sometimes they don't.
  - Doubling tips for a period of time, for instance.
  - Tell yourself before entering a season of Generosity,
    - When I see a homeless person, I'm going to say yes.
    - If someone asks, "can I?" the answer is going to be "yes".
    - If someone asks, "do you have?" the answer is going to be "yes" if I have it.
    - I'm going to double my tips.
    - I'm going to give twice as much.
    - I'm going to do whatever I can do to practice generosity.
- **Submission:** Sometimes we find ourselves in a situation were we disagree with those around us about non-ethical or -moral issues and these are great opportunities to practice submission.
- **Gratitude:** The Jewish community tries to say 70 blessings a day.
  - Try saying "thanks" 70 times a day.
  - [*One Thousand Gifts* by Ann Voskamp](https://amzn.to/2nFfpJU)
- **Meditation and Memorization:** To be able to meditate on the scripture by being able to put it inside of you.
  - We like to study, read, and learn about the Bible but often stop there.
  - The Qumran community of walking the path.
  - A fun discipline is writing the Text.
  - A difficult discipline is memorizing the text.
  - How do we get the text IN us in as many ways as possible?
  - How does Ray memorize?
    - Marty had an image of stacking and being able to recite an entire book all at once.
    - Ray instead taught Marty of memorize a weekly portion and at the end of the week, put them away and move on to the next portion.
      - "You've done your part now let the Holy Spirit do his part."
- **Spiritual Mentor:** Pick a spiritual mentor that you know and trust, who you believe knows you in a unique way that most people don't and who you will listen to when they tell you that you need to do something new or to remove something from you life.
- **Fasting and Self Denial:** Going for a period of time without food or water.
  - [*Finding Our Way Again* by Brian McLaren](https://amzn.to/2nLftII)
    > "Fasting does not create space where we are supposed to be more spiritual, fasting connects us to our humanness."
  - Marty would get so angry when he fasts because when he would get hungry, we would become obsessed with food when he felt like he was supposed to be incredibly spiritual.
  - Anyone who has fasted past the three day mark knows that fasting connects you to the brokenness and the ugliest parts of their life.
  - Often in the Text, when people fast, G-d critiques it.
  - Marty doesn't fast regularly but will fast when he becomes prideful to remind himself of his humanity.
  - Brent: "Fasting reveals our weakness in a way that creates space for G-d to be strong in our life?"
    - Absolutely.
    - We often use fasting like a vending machine to get answers from G-d.
    - With the exception of two times, fasting happens for two reasons in scripture: humility and mourning.
    - When we want answers, a lot of the wrong things go to work inside of us. We remind ourselves of who we are and look to G-d out of the appropriate perspective and in that we often do find the clarity that shows us the answers that were really there the whole time. We just needed the space to be able to see it.
- **Feasting and Celebration:** Some of us are incredibly frugal and need to learn how to celebrate.
  - Talmud (NOT the Bible) teaches that "man will have to answer on Judgement day for every permissible deed he did not partake in."
  - One one hand, I need to know when to say no and on the other hand, I need to know when to indulge because it's time to celebrate.
  - The calendar helps us do this.
    - Lent invites us to fast. Celebration Sunday invites us to celebrate.
    - Advent brings us down and invites us to frugality of our spirituality. Christmas then invites us to celebrate.

#### Summary

- All of these practices help us create a space. If we create a space for G-d to work, he will fill it and he will produce the fruit that he wants to produce.
- Brent realized that he actually mixed the "fixed hour" disciple with scripture memorization instead of prayer in the past.

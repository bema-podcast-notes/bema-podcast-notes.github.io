### BEMA Episode 28: Images of the Desert — Ar'ar and Tamarisk

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode explores two significant desert plants - the Ar'ar bush and the Tamarisk tree - as biblical imagery for understanding spiritual truths about trust, faithfulness, and generational impact. The discussion builds on previous episodes about the Tabernacle, priesthood, and the Israelites' wilderness experience as a "honeymoon in the desert" following their covenant relationship with God at Mount Sinai.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Priests as Opulent Delegates**: Hebrew "kohen" means one who undertakes another's cause and represents divine abundance
- **Ar'ar Bush Paradox**: Beautiful exterior concealing toxic, empty interior - represents trusting in human flesh/abilities
- **Acacia Tree Wisdom**: Appears dead externally but contains life-giving resources - represents trusting in God's provision
- **Tamarisk Tree Legacy**: Takes 80 years to mature, planted for future generations - symbolizes long-term kingdom investment
- **Jeremiah 17 Connection**: Contrasts cursed reliance on human strength with blessed trust in God through desert plant imagery
- **Generational Thinking**: The question "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" challenges us to invest in future generations

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Priestly Identity and Role

The Hebrew word "kohen" (priest) carries two essential meanings from cognate languages:

- **Deputy/Delegate**: One who undertakes another's cause, standing in the gap between God and people
- **Opulence/Abundance**: Representatives displaying the richness of God's realm through their appearance and actions

This dual role involves both pleading the people's cause to God and presenting God's cause to the people, making priests bidirectional mediators dressed to reflect heavenly abundance.

##### Desert Plant Symbolism Framework

The episode establishes a comprehensive symbolic system using desert vegetation:

**Ar'ar Bush (ערער)**:

- Linguistically connected to "arur" (curse) - strongest Hebrew word for binding someone to destruction
- Visually stunning with bright green foliage and yellow branches
- Internally toxic and empty - fruit appears promising but contains only cobwebs and poisonous milky substance
- Represents those who trust in human abilities and appear successful externally but lack substance

**Acacia Tree (Rotem)**:

- Can appear completely dead for extended periods
- Called "gift of the desert" by Bedouins for its life-sustaining properties
- Primary wood used in Tabernacle construction (Ark of Covenant, altars, poles)
- When overlaid with gold, creates "opulent delegate" imagery - beautiful exterior with strong, durable interior
- Represents faithful trust in God that may appear unremarkable but provides lasting value

**Tamarisk Tree**:

- Requires cultivation and 80 years to reach maturity
- Creates shade 15% cooler than standard shade through moisture redistribution
- Considered a luxury tree in ancient culture (referenced in Akkadian poetry alongside date palms)
- Symbolizes generational investment and long-term kingdom thinking

##### Jeremiah 17 Theological Framework

The passage creates a deliberate contrast using wordplay:

- "Arur" (cursed) connects to "ar'ar" (bush) in "arava" (desert wasteland)
- Cursed person trusting in flesh becomes like the toxic ar'ar bush
- Blessed person trusting in God becomes like the life-giving tree by water (acacia)
- This establishes external appearance versus internal reality as a key biblical theme

##### Abraham's Covenant Symbolism

Abraham's planting of a tamarisk tree at Beersheba after making a treaty represents:

- Faith in God's long-term promises extending beyond his lifetime
- Calling on "Adonai Olam" (Eternal God) - connecting tree's longevity to God's eternal nature
- Physical witness to covenant faithfulness for future generations
- Statement of belief in God's continued work in that place

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Priesthood Applications

- **Corporate Leadership**: Representing company values while advocating for employee needs
- **Parenting**: Modeling godly abundance while interceding for children's spiritual development  
- **Ministry**: Displaying God's richness through lifestyle while addressing community needs
- **Teaching**: Presenting eternal truths with excellence while understanding student struggles

##### Ar'ar vs. Acacia in Contemporary Context

- **Social Media Presence**: Curated perfection (ar'ar) versus authentic struggle and growth (acacia)
- **Career Success**: Impressive credentials hiding moral emptiness versus quiet integrity producing lasting impact
- **Church Culture**: Flashy programs lacking spiritual depth versus humble faithfulness bearing genuine fruit
- **Personal Relationships**: Surface-level charm masking selfishness versus unassuming loyalty providing security

##### Tamarisk Tree Investment Strategies

- **Mentoring**: Investing in younger believers who will impact generations beyond our reach
- **Educational Giving**: Supporting institutions that will train future leaders
- **Environmental Stewardship**: Making sustainable choices for future generations
- **Church Planting**: Establishing congregations that will multiply long after founders are gone
- **Writing/Teaching**: Creating resources that will benefit people we'll never meet

##### Biblical Botanical Understanding

This approach to Scripture demonstrates how cultural and environmental knowledge enhances textual meaning:

- Plant characteristics illuminate spiritual metaphors
- Hebrew wordplay reveals deeper theological connections
- Visual imagery makes abstract concepts concrete and memorable
- Historical context enriches contemporary application

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Scriptural Studies

- **Comprehensive plant imagery study**: Examining all biblical references to desert vegetation and their symbolic meanings
- **Priestly garment symbolism**: Detailed analysis of how priestly clothing reflected divine abundance
- **Covenant witness markers**: Other instances where physical objects commemorate spiritual commitments
- **Jeremiah's agricultural metaphors**: Broader study of agricultural imagery in prophetic literature

##### Cultural and Historical Research  

- **Ancient Near Eastern botanical knowledge**: How contemporary cultures understood these plants
- **Rabbinic interpretations**: Traditional Jewish teachings about these biblical images
- **Archaeological evidence**: Physical remains of ancient cultivation practices
- **Bedouin wisdom traditions**: Traditional desert survival knowledge and plant usage

##### Theological Themes

- **Appearance versus reality**: Biblical warnings against superficial assessment
- **Generational covenant thinking**: How biblical characters invested in future generations
- **Divine patience and timing**: God's long-term perspective on spiritual development
- **Stewardship ethics**: Responsibility to future generations in various life domains

##### Practical Applications

- **Mentoring programs**: Developing systematic approaches to generational investment
- **Spiritual formation**: Creating practices that build internal strength over external appearance
- **Community building**: Establishing sustainable institutions that outlast founders
- **Personal evaluation**: Tools for assessing whether our lives reflect ar'ar or acacia characteristics

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analyze the priestly role**: How do the two aspects of priesthood - being a delegate/deputy and displaying opulence - work together in both ancient Israel and contemporary Christian life? Provide specific examples of how modern believers might fulfill both functions.

2. **Compare and contrast**: Create a detailed comparison between the ar'ar bush and acacia tree, explaining how their physical characteristics relate to spiritual principles about trust and faithfulness. How might these principles apply to evaluating modern churches or Christian leaders?

3. **Examine the linguistic connections**: Explain the Hebrew wordplay in Jeremiah 17 between "arur" (cursed), "ar'ar" (bush), and "arava" (wasteland). How does this linguistic artistry enhance the theological message, and what does this teach us about biblical interpretation methods?

4. **Evaluate generational investment**: Abraham's tamarisk tree planting represents long-term kingdom thinking. Identify three specific areas in your life where you could plant "tamarisk trees" - investments that primarily benefit future generations rather than yourself. Explain your reasoning for each choice.

5. **Apply the desert imagery framework**: Choose a current personal challenge or decision you're facing. Using the desert plant imagery from this episode (ar'ar, acacia, and tamarisk), analyze your situation and determine which approach would be most faithful to biblical wisdom. Justify your analysis with specific references to the plant characteristics discussed.

#### Personal Summary

This episode masterfully demonstrates how biblical imagery drawn from the natural world can illuminate profound spiritual truths about authenticity, faithfulness, and generational impact. The contrast between the deceptively beautiful but toxic ar'ar bush and the apparently lifeless but life-giving acacia tree challenges us to examine whether our spiritual lives prioritize external appearance or internal substance.

The priestly concept of being an "opulent delegate" offers a compelling framework for Christian living - representing God's abundance while advocating for others' needs. This dual role requires both displaying divine richness and undertaking others' causes, creating a balanced approach to spiritual influence.

Perhaps most powerfully, the tamarisk tree metaphor reframes how we measure success and impact. Abraham's 80-year investment in a tree he would never see fully grown challenges our immediate-gratification culture and calls us to plant seeds for spiritual grandchildren we may never meet. The rabbinic question "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" becomes a daily examination of conscience, pushing us beyond personal benefit toward kingdom legacy.

The episode's integration of Hebrew linguistics, botanical knowledge, and theological insight exemplifies how cultural context enriches biblical understanding. Rather than merely reading over seemingly insignificant details like Abraham planting a tree, we discover profound statements of faith and theological conviction embedded in everyday actions.

These desert images ultimately call us to authentic discipleship - avoiding the ar'ar's hollow attractiveness, embracing the acacia's patient faithfulness, and committing to the tamarisk's generational vision. In a world obsessed with immediate results and external validation, these ancient plants offer timeless wisdom about what truly matters in God's kingdom economy.

### BEMA Episode 28 Study Notes: Images of the Desert — Ar'ar and Tamarisk

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode explores two significant desert plants - the ar'ar bush and the tamarisk tree - as biblical metaphors for different approaches to life and faith. Part of BEMA's series on desert imagery, this teaching uses botanical knowledge to illuminate spiritual truths found in Jeremiah 17 and Genesis 21.

#### Key Takeaways

- The ar'ar bush represents those who trust in human strength rather than God - attractive externally but empty and toxic internally
- The acacia tree symbolizes those who trust in the Lord - may appear lifeless but contain deep reserves of spiritual vitality
- The tamarisk tree teaches us about legacy and long-term thinking - doing things that benefit future generations rather than immediate personal gain
- Desert imagery in Scripture becomes more meaningful when we understand the actual characteristics of these plants
- True spiritual maturity involves planting "tamarisk trees" - investments that will benefit others long after we're gone

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Ar'ar Bush - False Promise

The ar'ar bush serves as a powerful metaphor in Jeremiah 17:5-6. This desert plant appears lush and fruitful from the outside, with bright green foliage and grapefruit-sized fruit. However, when examined closely, the fruit is completely hollow except for a toxic, milky substance around the edges. The bush represents people who "trust in man" and "draw strength from mere flesh" rather than relying on God.

Key characteristics:

- Visually attractive and promising
- Completely empty inside
- Contains toxic substances
- Found in wasteland and parched places
- Deceptive in its apparent abundance

##### The Acacia Tree - True Substance  

Contrasted with the ar'ar, the acacia tree (referenced in both Psalm 1 and Jeremiah 17:7-8) represents those who trust in the Lord. While it may appear dead or unremarkable on the surface, it contains deep internal resources that allow it to flourish when conditions are right.

Key characteristics:

- May appear lifeless or unimpressive
- Contains deep internal vitality
- Sends out roots by streams of water
- Leaves remain green (perseveres through drought)
- Never fails to bear fruit when conditions allow

##### The Tamarisk Tree - Legacy Thinking

The tamarisk tree represents generational thinking and legacy building. This "luxury tree" requires cultivation and takes 80 years to reach maturity, meaning those who plant it will never enjoy its full benefits themselves.

Key characteristics:

- Requires intentional planting and cultivation
- Takes 80 years to mature
- Provides exceptional shade (15% cooler than normal desert shade)
- Absorbs moisture from the air and creates a more comfortable microclimate
- Represents investment in future generations

##### Empire vs. Shalom Leadership Paradigm

The episode reinforces the ongoing BEMA theme contrasting two leadership styles:

- Empire: Leadership through fear, coercion, and "the stick" (like Pharaoh)
- Shalom: Leadership through voice and shepherding care

#### Examples & Applications

##### Biblical Applications

- **Abraham's Tamarisk (Genesis 21)**: After making a treaty with Abimelech, Abraham plants a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, demonstrating his faith that his descendants will remain in the promised land for generations
- **Jeremiah's Contrast (Jeremiah 17:5-8)**: The prophet uses the ar'ar and acacia to illustrate two fundamentally different approaches to life - trusting in human strength versus trusting in God

##### Modern Applications

- **Spiritual Disciplines**: Like the acacia tree, consistent spiritual practices may seem unrewarding in the short term but develop deep roots that sustain us through difficult seasons
- **Legacy Building**: The "tamarisk question" - "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" challenges us to consider what we're doing that will benefit future generations
- **Discernment**: The ar'ar bush warns us about being deceived by external appearances in leadership, relationships, or spiritual matters

##### Practical Questions for Reflection

- What "ar'ar bushes" in my life look promising but may be spiritually empty or toxic?
- How am I developing "acacia tree" characteristics - deep roots that can sustain me through drought?
- What "tamarisk trees" am I planting that will benefit others long after I'm gone?

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Biblical Botany

- Study other significant trees and plants mentioned in Scripture (cedar of Lebanon, olive trees, fig trees, etc.)
- Research the work of Nogah Hareuveni, the leading expert on biblical botany mentioned in the episode
- Explore how understanding the physical characteristics of biblical flora enhances spiritual understanding

##### Desert Spirituality

- Examine other desert imagery in Scripture (wilderness wandering, desert as place of testing and revelation)
- Study the Desert Fathers and their spiritual insights gained from desert living
- Explore how physical environments shape spiritual metaphors and understanding

##### Leadership and Legacy

- Investigate other biblical examples of generational thinking and legacy building
- Study the concept of covenant relationships that span generations
- Explore modern applications of servant leadership versus authoritarian control

##### Hermeneutical Approach

- Examine how cultural and geographical context enhances biblical interpretation
- Study the importance of understanding ancient Near Eastern customs and environment
- Explore the balance between historical-cultural interpretation and contemporary application

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Compare and Contrast**: How do the ar'ar bush and acacia tree serve as contrasting metaphors in Jeremiah 17? What specific characteristics of each plant support the spiritual lesson being taught?

2. **Application**: What does it mean practically to "plant tamarisk trees" in your daily life? Give three specific examples of activities or investments that might represent "tamarisk tree thinking."

3. **Biblical Context**: How does Abraham's planting of the tamarisk tree in Genesis 21 demonstrate his faith in God's promises? What was he communicating through this action?

4. **Spiritual Discernment**: Using the ar'ar bush as a metaphor, describe how someone might identify "ar'ar bush" situations in modern life - things that appear promising externally but are empty or harmful internally.

5. **Long-term Perspective**: The rabbinical question "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" challenges immediate gratification thinking. How does this concept relate to spiritual disciplines and the development of Christian character?

#### Personal Summary

This episode powerfully illustrates how understanding the physical characteristics of biblical flora can dramatically enhance our comprehension of spiritual truths. The ar'ar bush serves as a warning against trusting in human strength or being deceived by external appearances - things that look promising but are ultimately empty and toxic. In contrast, the acacia tree represents the person who trusts in God, developing deep roots that sustain them through difficult seasons, even when they may appear unremarkable to others.

Perhaps most challenging is the concept of the tamarisk tree, which calls us to think beyond our immediate circumstances and invest in things that will benefit future generations. Abraham's simple act of planting a tamarisk tree becomes a profound statement of faith in God's promises and commitment to generational blessing. The rabbinical question "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" challenges our natural tendency toward immediate gratification and calls us to consider the lasting impact of our daily choices and spiritual disciplines.

These desert images remind us that true spiritual maturity often involves patience, perseverance, and a willingness to invest in things whose benefits we may never fully see in our lifetime.

### Original Notes

### Review

- We've been talking about desert images.
- We are coming toward the end of Torah
- We went through Genesis
  - We talked about the Preface and the Introduction
  - The big ideas like who is G-d, who is man, what is this world like and what is G-d up to?
  - The Introduction Gen 12-50 then took us into the Family of G-d.
  - When we take these big picture ideas and apply them to real-life practical situations, this is what it looks like to partner with G-d as we wrestle with the story.
- Exodus
  - Rescue from the plagues
  - Wedding at Mt. Sinai
  - The Honeymoon Suite called the Tabernacle (a retelling of Gen 1 where the priests will work)
- Leviticus
  - People were previously told that if they partnered with G-d and entered into a covenant with him that they would become an entire Kingdom of Priests
  - Leviticus describes what it's like to be a priest and what it means to be a priest as well.
  - The book becomes a manual for priesthood.
- Numbers aka "Honeymoon in the Desert"
  - This is a time where the Israelites spend a honeymoon period in the desert.
  - In order to truly understand Numbers, the "Images of the Desert" episodes attempt to acquaint listeners with what the desert is really like.
  - Images
    - Shepherd
      - You learn about what it means to lead
      - What it means to listen to the voice
      - Two types of leadership: Empire (stick) vs Shalom (shepherd and voice)
        - Instead of leading with fear, coercion, and a stick, the desert teaches how to lead with our voice as a shepherd taking care of flocks of sheep.
    - Rotem Tree
      - We learned about the importance of shade.
      - Shade is something that you will never miss again as you read through scripture.
    - Acacia Tree

### Ar'ar

- There are images in the presentation.
- The Ar'ar bush
- This bush is a bright green, luscious bush with large fruit.
  - "It's got to be delicious."
- This bush is in fact toxic
- The fruit feels full and firm like a normal fruit however it's mostly empty and makes a popping sound when it's opened.
  - Its actual contents are mostly empty but also contains a toxic milky substance and some spider web looking material.
- There is a lot of discussion and argument about the actual species of the trees and bushes that are mentioned in the Text.
- Marty works off of the work of [Noga Hareuveni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noga_Hareuveni).
  - Noga has taught the teachers that have taught him.
  - Noga believes that the bush mentioned in Jeremiah 17:5 is the Ar'ar.
    > [Jer 17:5-8 NIV] 5 This is what the LORD says: "Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the LORD. 6 That person will be like a bush `(Hebrew says כְּעַרְעָר pronounced kuh-awr-awr meaning "like bush" or "like a bush")` in the wastelands; they will not see prosperity when it comes. They will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives. 7 "But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. 8 They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit."
    - Toward the end of this passage, we see the author mention another tree that resembles what we read about in Psalm 1.
    - When Noga identifies these two trees, he juxtaposes the ar'ar with the acacia.
    - Jeremiah is talking about two different people
      - One trusts in man, the power and strength of their own flesh. They do not trust in the Lord.
      - The other one trusts in the Lord rather than what they themselves are able to make and produce.
      - Jeremiah uses metaphor to illustrate the differences between the two people by describing these two trees.
      - The ar'ar bush, the one who trusts in man and looks great on the outside. It appears that he has it all together.
      - "The one who trusts in flesh is like an ar'ar bush. He looks amazing on the outside but inside he's just full of death and toxic emptiness. However, the one who trusts in the Lord is like an acacia tree. He can look completely dead and then ten years later when the rain comes, it bursts to life. One looks alive on the outside but is actually the opposite inside. The other looks dead on the outside but deep down actually has what it takes to bring life and become the gift of the desert."

### Tamarisk

- There are lots of different kinds of tamarisk. Trees, bushes, shrubs.
- The tree though, is almost always planted.
- It can grow naturally in its own habitat but it's usually planted especially if you find it in the desert.
- It is planted because it requires some work and cultivation.
- The foliage of the tree absorbs the little bit of moisture that's in the air and puts it out in its shade which is significantly cooler, 15% maybe, than the shade found elsewhere in the desert.
- The other stunning thing about a tamarisk tree is that it takes 80 years to grow.
- This means these trees are not typically planted for the person who planted the tree or even for his children.
- Tamarisk trees are typically planted for grandchildren.
- A rabbinic teaching that exists asks the question, "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?"
  - How many things are you doing daily that will live beyond you? That your grandchildren will reap the benefits of?
  - Marty recalled the passionate discussion about spiritual disciplines and doing then whether he feels like doing them that day or not.
  - One of things that we learn in the desert is how to do things that will live far beyond us. To do things that we might never see the benefit of.
  - Hebrews 11, The Hall Of Faith: All the people that saw G-d's promise and welcomed it from a distance because they knew that it would be together with us that their sacrifices would be made perfect.
  - A passage that we might normally read over but that Marty finds very moving is at the end of Genesis 21, Abimelek and Avraham make a treaty and at the end of the passage, Avraham plants a tamarisk tree.
  > [Gen 21:32-34 NIV] 32 After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines. 33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD, the Eternal God. 34 And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
  - Without studying the tamarisk tree, we would never realize the statement Avraham is making both internally and externally that even in his old age, he plants a tamarisk tree because he plans to be there for a long time. Even when his grandchildren come around, they will still be there. That is how much he trusts in the promise of G-d.
  - Brent asks if Jacob ever returns to the tree. If not, what does that say about Jacob?

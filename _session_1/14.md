### BEMA Episode 14: Grappling with God, Part 2 - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 14: Grappling with God, Part 2 (E14v24)  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 32-35  
**Topic:** Jacob's wrestling match with God, reconciliation with Esau, and the continued journey of spiritual transformation

This episode continues the examination of Jacob's life, focusing on his famous wrestling encounter with God at the Jabbok River, his unexpected reconciliation with his brother Esau, and the ongoing challenges that reveal Jacob's incomplete transformation. The discussion explores themes of wrestling with God, the power of questions and doubt in faith, and the messy, non-linear nature of spiritual growth.

#### Key Takeaways

- Wrestling with God is not only acceptable but defining for God's people - the name "Israel" comes from this struggle
- Spiritual transformation is messy and non-linear; Jacob doesn't become perfect after his encounter with God
- Questions, doubts, and "what if" scenarios are essential parts of faith, not threats to it
- God values chutzpah (bold audacity) but it must be submitted to divine authority
- Names carry profound power and meaning in Hebrew culture, defining identity and destiny
- Reconciliation can happen even in the most broken relationships, but it doesn't always lead to complete restoration
- The consequences of our actions can follow us long after we think we've changed

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Wrestling Match at Jabbok (Genesis 32:22-32)

The mysterious encounter between Jacob and "a man" at the Jabbok River represents a pivotal moment in biblical narrative. Key elements include:

- **The Anonymous Wrestler:** The figure is deliberately mysterious - described only as "a man" who demonstrates supernatural power
- **The Magic Touch:** The figure can dislocate Jacob's hip with barely a touch, yet Jacob continues wrestling
- **The Name Change:** Jacob becomes Israel ("he who wrestles with God"), establishing the identity of God's people
- **The Blessing:** Jacob demands and receives a blessing, showing his persistence and spiritual hunger

##### The Power of Names in Hebrew Culture

Names in ancient Hebrew culture weren't arbitrary labels but prophetic declarations of identity and destiny:

- Names defined character and called forth potential
- Parents chose names prayerfully, considering the child's future role
- Changing someone's name represented fundamental transformation
- Jacob's name means "heel-grasper" or "supplanter" - defining his deceptive nature
- Israel means "he who wrestles with God" - redefining his relationship with the divine

##### The Wrestling Metaphor for Faith

The episode presents wrestling as the appropriate posture for believers:

- Wrestling requires engagement, not passive acceptance
- Questions and doubts are tools of spiritual growth, not enemies of faith
- The goal isn't to defeat God but to be transformed through the struggle
- A lifetime of wrestling is preferable to spiritual stagnation
- Churches that discourage questions miss the biblical model of faith

##### Chutzpah - Sacred Audacity

The concept of chutzpah (bold audacity or nerve) is presented as something God values:

- God loves passionate, fiery engagement rather than bland compliance
- Chutzpah must be submitted to divine authority to avoid destructive consequences
- Unchecked boldness can lead to deep pain and regret
- The key is channeling passionate engagement constructively

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Wrestling with Faith

Just as Jacob wrestled with fundamental questions about God's nature and purposes, contemporary believers can embrace:

- Asking "what if" questions about traditional interpretations
- Grappling with difficult passages or theological concepts
- Wrestling with personal doubts rather than suppressing them
- Engaging in theological discussions that challenge assumptions

##### The Incomplete Transformation

Jacob's story after wrestling demonstrates that spiritual encounters don't automatically perfect us:

- He still shows deception when avoiding traveling with Esau
- His response to Dinah's assault reveals continued self-centeredness
- He struggles with fear and anxiety about his family's future
- Growth happens gradually through continued challenges

##### Names and Identity Today

While we may not choose names with the same intentionality as ancient Hebrew culture, the principle applies:

- Our identities are shaped by how we understand ourselves before God
- Labels we accept (or reject) influence our spiritual development
- God may "rename" us through transformative experiences
- We can claim new identities as we grow in faith

##### Reconciliation Complexities

The Jacob-Esau reunion illustrates both the possibility and limitations of reconciliation:

- Forgiveness can happen even after deep betrayal
- Reconciliation doesn't always mean returning to previous relationship patterns
- Some wounds heal better with healthy distance than forced closeness
- Grace can surprise us in the most unlikely circumstances

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Biblical Wrestling Stories

- Other instances of wrestling or struggling with God in Scripture (Hosea 12:3-4, Job's complaints, Psalms of lament)
- The role of Jacob's wrestling in New Testament theology
- How this story influenced Jewish understanding of relationship with God

##### The Nature of Divine Encounters

- Different types of theophanies (divine appearances) in Genesis
- The relationship between dreams, visions, and physical encounters with God
- How divine encounters are described across different biblical texts

##### Family Dynamics in Genesis

- Patterns of deception and favoritism throughout Genesis families
- The role of women in these patriarchal narratives
- How family dysfunction shapes the chosen lineage

##### The Development of Hebrew Identity

- How the name "Israel" evolved from personal name to national identity
- The significance of the twelve tribes emerging from Jacob's sons
- Connection between personal transformation and national destiny

##### Theological Wrestling in Church History

- How different Christian traditions have viewed doubt and questioning
- The role of mystery and paradox in mature faith
- Historical figures who exemplified faithful wrestling with God

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis Question:** What specific elements in the wrestling story at Jabbok make it seem mysterious or even "ghost story-like" as Reed describes? How do these mysterious elements contribute to the story's theological significance?

2. **Application Question:** The episode suggests that churches sometimes discourage the kind of wrestling and questioning that Jacob exemplifies. How might faith communities better encourage healthy spiritual wrestling while maintaining core beliefs?

3. **Character Development:** How does Jacob's behavior after his wrestling encounter (particularly with Esau and during the Dinah incident) reveal that transformation is incomplete? What does this teach us about spiritual growth?

4. **Interpretive Question:** The hosts discuss whether the wrestling figure might represent "the spirit of Esau" or other interpretations. How do different interpretations of the wrestler's identity change our understanding of what Jacob was really wrestling with?

5. **Theological Reflection:** What is the significance of God's people being named after someone who "wrestles with God" rather than someone who simply obeys or worships? What does this suggest about the nature of faith?

#### Personal Summary

This episode powerfully reframes the relationship between faith and doubt, presenting wrestling with God not as a sign of weak faith but as the defining characteristic of God's people. Jacob's story reveals that spiritual transformation is neither instant nor complete - it's an ongoing process of engagement, struggle, and gradual change. The famous wrestling match at Jabbok becomes a paradigm for authentic faith that embraces questions, confronts difficulties, and refuses to let go until blessed.

Perhaps most significantly, the episode challenges common church cultures that discourage questioning or wrestling with difficult aspects of faith. Instead, it calls us to embrace our chutzpah - our spiritual audacity and passionate engagement - while submitting it to God's authority. Jacob's messy, incomplete transformation reminds us that spiritual growth happens through continued struggle rather than a single perfect encounter, making his story both more realistic and more hopeful for those of us still wrestling with our own questions and challenges.

### BEMA Episode 14: Grappling with God, Part 2 - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 14: Grappling with God, Part 2 (2017)  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 32-35  
**Topic:** Jacob's wrestling with God and the continuation of his character development, exploring themes of identity, wrestling with divine authority, and the transformative power of struggle in relationship with God.

#### Key Takeaways

- Wrestling with God is a defining characteristic of God's people, not a sign of weak faith
- True transformation often requires divine intervention and personal loss
- Names in Hebrew culture communicate essence and identity, not just labels
- God desires people with "chutzpah" (spiritual audacity) who will engage authentically
- Jacob's story demonstrates that God can use our passion and fire when surrendered to His purposes
- The name "Israel" means both "wrestled with God" and "God conquered," showing dual aspects of divine relationship
- Questioning and wrestling with faith is encouraged, not discouraged, in Hebrew tradition

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### **The Wrestling Match (Genesis 32:22-32)**

- Jacob wrestles with a mysterious figure described as both "man" and having divine authority
- The encounter occurs at a crucial transition point before meeting Esau
- Jacob receives a new name: Israel (Yisra-el: "wrestled with/conquered God")
- The physical limp serves as a permanent reminder of the encounter
- This story establishes wrestling with God as the defining characteristic of God's people

##### **Hebrew Understanding of Names**

- Names communicate essence and identity, not merely labels
- Jacob means "heel holder" or "usurper" - he lived out the negative aspects of his name
- Names can be lived out positively or negatively depending on one's choices
- The question "What is your name?" forces confrontation with true identity
- Name changes indicate fundamental identity transformation

##### **The Pattern of Divine Encounters**

- Abraham and Isaac built altars and "called on the name of the Lord"
- Jacob builds altars but the text notably omits calling on the Lord's name
- This pattern suggests Jacob's continued struggle with full surrender
- The repetition of the name change (Genesis 35) indicates incomplete transformation

##### **The Tragedy Pattern**

- God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" often precedes tragedy in Genesis
- Rachel's death in childbirth follows this pattern (like Noah's story)
- Jacob names the child Benjamin ("son of my right hand") instead of Rachel's choice Benoni ("son of my sorrow")
- Jacob later blames himself for Rachel's death due to his unknowing curse

##### **Two Name Changes: Two Different Meanings**

- First name change: Jacob wrestled with God and won (Jacob's victory)
- Second name change: God conquered Jacob (God's victory)
- This represents the progression from human striving to divine transformation
- True change comes when God finally "breaks" Jacob's self-reliance

#### Examples & Applications

##### **Modern Wrestling with Faith**

- Contemporary Christians often discouraged from questioning or wrestling with God
- The story validates doubt and struggle as healthy spiritual dynamics
- Discussion groups and Bible study should encourage wrestling with difficult questions
- Asking "what if" questions demonstrates engagement, not weak faith

##### **The Danger of Self-Reliance**

- Jacob's continued deception after wrestling shows incomplete transformation
- His lie to Esau about meeting him in Seir demonstrates unchanged character
- His selfish response to his sons' revenge in Shechem shows continued self-focus
- Only after losing Rachel does genuine transformation begin

##### **Chutzpah in Spiritual Life**

- God desires people with spiritual audacity and passion
- The blessing request from a stranger shows understanding of word power
- Jacob's persistence in wrestling demonstrates the kind of engagement God values
- Spiritual fire and passion can be redirected toward God's purposes

##### **Identity Crisis and Resolution**

- Jacob must confess his true identity ("heel holder") before receiving new identity
- The wrestling match forces confrontation with authentic self
- Modern believers must also face who they really are before transformation
- New identity comes through divine encounter, not self-improvement

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### **Theological Themes**

- The nature of divine-human encounters in Scripture
- The role of suffering and loss in spiritual formation
- Hebrew concepts of covenant and blessing
- The theology of names and identity in biblical culture

##### **Literary Analysis**

- Narrative patterns in Genesis (preface, introduction, family stories)
- The use of repetition and parallel structures in Hebrew storytelling
- Symbolism of physical markers (limping, pillars, name changes)
- Connections between Noah's story and Jacob's tragedy pattern

##### **Historical and Cultural Context**

- Ancient Near Eastern wrestling traditions and religious significance
- Hebrew understanding of blessing and curse formulations
- Patriarchal family structures and inheritance customs
- The geographical significance of Bethel, Peniel, and other locations

##### **Character Development Studies**

- Comparison of Jacob's character arc with other biblical figures
- The psychological aspects of identity transformation
- Family dynamics and their impact on spiritual development
- The relationship between human effort and divine grace

##### **Practical Applications**

- How to engage in healthy spiritual wrestling today
- Developing authentic prayer life that includes questions and doubts
- Understanding the difference between constructive and destructive chutzpah
- Learning to surrender personal agendas to divine purposes

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How does the Hebrew understanding of names change your interpretation of Jacob's wrestling match, and what does it mean that Jacob had to confess his true name before receiving a new one?**

2. **Compare and contrast the two times God changes Jacob's name to Israel. What evidence suggests these represent different stages of Jacob's spiritual transformation?**

3. **Analyze Jacob's behavior after the wrestling match (his deception of Esau, his response to the Shechem incident). What does this reveal about the nature of spiritual transformation?**

4. **How does the concept of "chutzpah" (spiritual audacity) challenge modern Christian attitudes toward questioning God and wrestling with faith?**

5. **Examine the pattern of "be fruitful and multiply" followed by tragedy in Genesis. How does Rachel's death fit this pattern, and what role does Jacob's unknowing curse play in the narrative?**

#### Personal Summary

BEMA Episode 14 presents Jacob's wrestling with God as a paradigm for authentic faith engagement rather than a crisis to be avoided. The episode challenges listeners to embrace spiritual wrestling as a defining characteristic of God's people, while warning against the dangers of incomplete surrender to divine purposes. Jacob's story demonstrates that God desires passionate, audacious believers who will engage authentically with Him, but this engagement must ultimately lead to divine victory rather than human triumph.

The dual meaning of "Israel" - both wrestling with God and being conquered by God - captures the tension of authentic spiritual life. The episode emphasizes that true transformation often comes through loss and brokenness rather than victory and success. Jacob's continued deception after his first divine encounter illustrates that spiritual experiences alone do not guarantee character change; only when Jacob loses what he values most (Rachel) does genuine transformation begin.

This teaching validates doubt and questioning as healthy spiritual dynamics while emphasizing the ultimate necessity of divine surrender. The story encourages believers to bring their full selves - including their struggles, questions, and spiritual fire - into relationship with God, trusting that He can redirect human passion toward divine purposes when properly surrendered.

### Original Notes

- Genesis 32-35
- Jacob prepares to meet Esau.
  - Jacob is afraid that Esau will attack him so he puts Leah and her family in front, then Rachel and her family next, and he taks up the back. Quite cowardly in some ways.
- Jacob wrestles with G-d.
  - Jacob actually wrestles with a man according the text.
  - The man changes Jacob's name. Name changes typically come from someone who has authority over another.
  - Jacob says he wrestles with G-d only when he remembers back.
  - Has Jacob wrestled with G-d literally or has he figureatively wrestled with G-d in life?
  - Jacob asks for a blessing from a random person which says a lot about the power of words in this culture.
  - G-d chooses people who are willing to wrestle with him.
    - A major premise for BEMA.
- Jacob meets Esau
  - It's common for people to believe the turning point in Jacob's story is when he wrestles with G-d.
    - However, Jacob decieves Esau when he says they'll meet in Seir but instead, Jacob goes and settles in Sukkoth.
- Dinah and the Shechemites
  - Dinah is raped and Jacob's son's setup a fake covenant with the people and kill them instead.
- Jacob Returns to Bethel
  - Jacob builds an alter but does not call on the name of the Lord like his fathers did.
  - G-d changes his name in Genesis 35:10: hadn't G-d already changed his name?
  - There are parallels in this story to Adam and Eve and Noah Leaving the Ark.
    - Be fruitful and increase in number
    - Tragedy will follow
- The Deaths of Rachel and Isaac
  - As Rachel dies in childbirth, she names names her child Ben-Oni which means "son of my trouble" but Jacob instead names him Benjamin meaning "son of my right hand."
    - When Jacob dies he ends up taking responsibility for the death of Rachel because of the oath that was made during the confrontation with Laban over stolen idols.
- Why does G-d change his name twice?
  - Israel means Conquored G-d but it can just as easily mean G-d Conquored.
    - When G-d wrestled with Jacob, Jacob won.
    - Doed G-d end up winning the second time? Does G-d get ahold of Jacob's life and change it?

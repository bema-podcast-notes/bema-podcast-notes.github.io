### BEMA Episode 71: The Prophetic Table - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 71: The Prophetic Table  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Release Date:** January 19, 2023

This episode explores the multifaceted dialogue and diverse voices found within the prophetic literature of the Hebrew Bible. Rather than presenting a singular perspective, the prophets represent battling viewpoints found among God's people as they attempted to respond to the effects of exile. Using the metaphor of two "tables"—one Babylonian and one Persian—the episode demonstrates how different prophetic voices offered varying solutions to the challenges of their contexts, and how this ongoing dialogue remains relevant for contemporary believers.

#### Key Takeaways

- The prophetic literature is not a monolithic voice but represents an ongoing dialogue with multiple perspectives on how to respond to exile and empire.
- The "Babylonian Table" includes voices like Isaiah (stand and suffer), Ezekiel/Habakkuk/Job (learn to live in exile), and Jeremiah/Zephaniah (focus on repentance and covenant restoration).
- The "Persian Table" includes Ezra/Nehemiah/Haggai/Zechariah (return and rebuild), Esther/Daniel (accommodate and resist), and Malachi (obedience above all).
- Scripture is not meant to be read as a codified list of rules but as a living dialogue that invites wrestling and contextual application.
- Different contexts require different prophetic voices—there is no single "right answer" that applies universally across all situations.
- For 21st-century Western believers, the Esther-Daniel model of "accommodation and resistance" may be most applicable, though other contexts might require embracing different prophetic voices.
- The Jewish approach to scripture emphasizes wrestling with the text rather than seeking simple, propositional answers.

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Babylonian Table Metaphor

The first major concept is the image of a table set during the Babylonian exile period, around which various prophetic voices gather to discuss the central question: "What do we do about Babylon?"

**Three Main Perspectives:**

1. **Isaiah's Voice - Stand and Suffer**
   - Emphasis on standing publicly for God's justice and God's way
   - Confronting empire directly, even at great personal cost
   - The Suffering Servant discourse (Third Isaiah) exemplifies this approach
   - Core message: Resist empire, stand for righteousness, accept the suffering that comes with prophetic witness

2. **Ezekiel, Habakkuk, and Job - Accept Exile as Home**
   - Recognition that exile is the new reality and will last for an extended period
   - Focus on learning to live faithfully in a difficult context rather than fighting it
   - Acknowledging that Babylonian ways aren't right while accepting the need to adapt
   - Core message: Make the best of where you are, learn to be faithful in this place

3. **Jeremiah and Zephaniah - Repentance and Covenant Restoration**
   - Emphasis on *t'shuva* (repentance/returning to God)
   - The primary issue is not political circumstances but the broken covenant relationship with God
   - Restoration of relationship with God takes priority over questions of staying or leaving
   - Core message: Get right with God first; let God worry about everything else

##### The Persian Table Metaphor

The second table is set during the Persian period, a different context where the question shifts to: "What do we do about Persia?" The Persian empire treated the Jewish people very differently from Babylon—not as captives in bondage but with relative freedom, including permission to return to their homeland.

**Three Main Perspectives:**

1. **Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah - Return and Rebuild**
   - The largest group at this table
   - Emphasis on physical return to Jerusalem and restoration of the temple, walls, and community
   - It will be difficult, but it's worth the effort
   - Core message: Go back home, rebuild God's house, restore what was lost

2. **Esther and Daniel - Accommodation and Resistance**
   - Stay in Persia but with shrewd wisdom, not assimilation
   - Honor the king while shrewdly subverting empire's ways
   - Engage and influence Persia, bring shalom order to imperial chaos
   - Resist through wisdom and strategic positioning rather than abandonment
   - "Shrewd as serpents, innocent as doves"
   - Core message: Stay and make a difference where you are through wise resistance

3. **Malachi - Obedience Regardless of Location**
   - Stands somewhat alone with a focus on obedience to God
   - It doesn't matter whether you stay or return—what matters is faithful obedience
   - Don't rob God, don't dishonor God, don't give blemished offerings
   - Core message: Wherever you go, whatever you do, obey God

##### Source A and Source B - Historical Precedent for Multiple Perspectives

The episode references an earlier BEMA discussion about different historical sources in the Hebrew Bible:

- **Source A:** Samuel and Kings - presented as "agenda-driven headlines" with a current-events perspective
- **Source B:** Chronicles - presented as a "documentary perspective" looking back and reassessing events

The key insight: Neither source is "wrong"—both are accurate but represent different perspectives. This establishes the biblical pattern of holding multiple viewpoints in tension rather than collapsing everything into a single narrative.

##### The Nature of Scripture - Living Dialogue vs. Codified Rules

A central theological claim of this episode is that Scripture should not be understood as:
- A codified list of things to do
- A "read-the-Bible-do-what-it-says" instruction manual
- A collection of propositional answers to decipher through exegesis

Instead, Scripture should be understood as:
- A living, God-breathed (*inspired*) dialogue
- An ongoing conversation that continues into the present
- A story of God's people figuring out how to walk many different roads in different circumstances
- An invitation to wrestling rather than simple obedience to clear commands

##### Contextual Application - Different Voices for Different Situations

The episode strongly emphasizes that different contexts require embracing different prophetic voices:

**For 21st Century American/Western Believers:**
- The Esther-Daniel model of "accommodation and resistance" is most applicable
- Living under a relatively benign empire (similar to Persia) requires shrewd engagement
- Must resist imperial narratives while living within the system

**For Persecuted Believers (e.g., Egypt, Libya):**
- The Ezra-Nehemiah "return and rebuild" narrative may be most relevant
- After churches are burned and communities destroyed, the message of rebuilding brings hope
- Zechariah's apocalyptic literature provides hope for the present struggle

**For Believers in Other Contexts (e.g., parts of Europe):**
- The Malachi narrative of obedience might be most fitting
- Different social, political, and cultural contexts call for different emphases

##### The Jewish Approach to Wrestling with Scripture

The episode includes a parable (attributed to Peter Rollins, possibly from the Talmud) about two rabbis who argue daily about an issue. When God comes down to settle the argument, both rabbis tell God to leave so they can continue arguing. The point: In Jewish tradition, the power is in the ongoing wrestling, not in arriving at a final answer.

This contrasts sharply with the common Christian approach of "God said it, I believe it, that settles it." The Jewish perspective would be: "God said it, and now we all have to wrestle with it."

##### Partnership with God's Mission

The episode concludes by framing the prophetic dialogue in terms of partnership (*sh'tuf*) with God. The Torah established the concept of humanity as God's partner. The prophetic literature then explores the question: "As partners with God in His mission, what does that mission demand in our specific context?"

This partnership model means:
- Engaging deeply with Scripture as dialogue
- Discerning what God's mission requires in different situations
- Making contextual decisions rather than applying universal formulas
- Continual wrestling with appropriate responses

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Examples from the Text

**Esther's Shrewd Wisdom:**
- She lived in the Persian court without assimilating
- She honored the king while subverting empire through strategic action
- She risked her life ("If I perish, I perish") to save her people
- She engaged the system to bring justice and shalom

**Daniel's Resistance:**
- He refused to bow to the image despite consequences
- He continued to pray openly even when it meant the lion's den
- He served in the imperial court while maintaining faithfulness to God
- He demonstrated that staying in empire doesn't mean compromising convictions

**Nehemiah's Rebuilding:**
- He left a comfortable position in Persia to rebuild Jerusalem's walls
- He faced opposition and discouragement but persisted
- He combined practical action with prayer and spiritual renewal
- He embodied the "return and rebuild" narrative

##### Contemporary Applications

**For Western/American Believers:**
The Esther-Daniel model suggests:
- Participating in civic and cultural systems without fully assimilating
- Bringing Kingdom values into workplaces, neighborhoods, and political spheres
- Resisting consumerism, nationalism, and other imperial values while living in that society
- Strategic engagement rather than withdrawal or uncritical acceptance

**For Persecuted Believers:**
The Ezra-Nehemiah-Zechariah model suggests:
- Continuing to rebuild faith communities even after violence and opposition
- Drawing hope from apocalyptic visions that God will ultimately vindicate His people
- Persisting in restoration work despite discouragement
- Community solidarity in the face of external threats

**For Believers Navigating Moral Confusion:**
The Malachi model suggests:
- Returning to fundamentals of obedience and faithfulness
- Not using circumstances as an excuse for compromised worship
- Giving God the best rather than "blemished offerings"
- Maintaining integrity regardless of external pressures

**For All Believers:**
The concept of ongoing dialogue suggests:
- Reading Scripture with "open hands" rather than closed fists
- Gathering with others to wrestle with biblical texts in community
- Avoiding the temptation to oversimplify complex issues
- Recognizing that different situations might call for different biblical emphases

##### Real-World Scenario: Social Justice vs. Personal Piety

A contemporary church might face the question: "Should we focus on social justice issues (feeding the poor, addressing systemic injustice) or on personal spiritual formation (prayer, worship, evangelism)?"

The prophetic table model suggests this is a false binary:
- The Isaiah voice calls for standing against injustice even at cost
- The Jeremiah/Zephaniah voice emphasizes covenant relationship and repentance
- The Malachi voice stresses obedience and proper worship
- All three voices are valid and needed in different proportions depending on context

Rather than choosing one, a community might ask: "What does our particular context require? What voice is most needed in our time and place?" The answer might vary by location, cultural moment, and specific challenges faced.

2. **Contextual Application:** The episode argues that 21st-century Western believers should primarily embrace the Esther-Daniel model of "accommodation and resistance" from the Persian Table. Do you agree with this assessment? Why or why not? What would this look like in practice in your specific cultural context?

3. **Theological Framework:** How does the concept of Scripture as "ongoing dialogue" challenge or complement traditional evangelical views of biblical authority and inspiration? Can Scripture be both authoritative and multivocal?

4. **Historical Understanding:** Explain the difference between the Babylonian context and the Persian context, and why this difference matters for understanding which prophetic voices are speaking to each situation. How do different imperial policies call for different forms of faithful response?

5. **Personal Reflection:** Think about a significant decision or challenge you're currently facing. Which voice from the prophetic tables (Isaiah's resistance, Ezekiel's acceptance, Jeremiah's repentance, Ezra's rebuilding, Esther's shrewd engagement, or Malachi's obedience) speaks most powerfully to your situation? Why? How might listening to a different prophetic voice change your perspective?

#### Personal Summary

BEMA Episode 71 presents a paradigm-shifting approach to reading the prophetic literature of the Hebrew Bible. Rather than attempting to harmonize all prophetic voices into a single, unified message, Marty Solomon invites listeners to sit at two metaphorical tables—one Babylonian and one Persian—and listen to the rich diversity of perspectives on how to respond faithfully to empire and exile.

At the Babylonian Table, Isaiah advocates for public resistance and willingness to suffer, Ezekiel and his companions counsel accepting exile as a new home and learning to live there faithfully, while Jeremiah and Zephaniah insist that the primary issue is restoring covenant relationship with God through repentance. Each voice addresses the same crisis but sees different priorities and solutions.

At the Persian Table, set in a different imperial context with different opportunities and challenges, we hear Ezra and Nehemiah calling people to return and rebuild Jerusalem, Esther and Daniel modeling how to stay engaged with empire through shrewd resistance, and Malachi emphasizing obedience to God regardless of location or circumstance.

The episode's most radical claim is that none of these voices is simply "right" or "wrong"—all are valid responses to their contexts, and Scripture preserves this diversity intentionally. Different believers in different situations will need to emphasize different prophetic voices. For contemporary Western believers living under relatively benign empire (like Persia more than Babylon), the Esther-Daniel model of accommodation and resistance may be most applicable. But for persecuted believers, the Ezra-Nehemiah message of rebuilding despite opposition might be most needed. For those in moral confusion, Malachi's call to obedience could be primary.

This reframes the purpose of Bible reading from "discovering the right answer" to "entering into an ongoing dialogue" where God's people continually wrestle with what faithful partnership with God's mission requires in their specific contexts. This is deeply Jewish in its approach—when God speaks, the response is not to end the conversation but to begin wrestling with the text in community.

For modern readers, this means approaching Scripture with open hands, recognizing that the Bible is more alive and dynamic than a simple instruction manual. It is a collection of voices in conversation, inviting us into that same conversation as we seek to discern faithful responses to the empires, injustices, and challenges of our own day. The power lies not in finding the final answer but in the ongoing wrestling itself—in community, with humility, and with commitment to God's mission in the world.

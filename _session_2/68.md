### BEMA Episode 68: Zechariah - Apocalyptic Literature

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode explores the prophetic ministry of Zechariah, a contemporary of Haggai who ministered to the post-exilic Jewish remnant returning to Jerusalem. The discussion focuses on understanding apocalyptic literature as a literary genre designed to convey hope through symbols and images, rather than as a blueprint for predicting future events. The hosts examine how Zechariah encouraged the struggling community to persevere under Persian rule and how his imagery profoundly influenced later biblical writings, particularly the book of Revelation.

#### Key Takeaways

- Apocalyptic literature uses symbols and images to convey hope to present-day audiences, not to map out detailed predictions of the end times
- Zechariah and Haggai likely grew up together as toddlers among the first waves of returnees to Jerusalem and may have been trained as prophets together
- Zechariah's ministry spanned decades (compared to Haggai's few months), providing ongoing encouragement to the struggling remnant
- The prophecy of a king riding on a donkey (Zechariah 9:9-10) originally encouraged the people to persevere under Persian rule, teaching that their rescue would come through God's providence and humility, not military might
- Almost all apocalyptic images in Zechariah appear later in the book of Revelation, demonstrating how New Testament authors drew deeply from Hebrew Scripture
- The primary function of apocalyptic literature is to encourage faithfulness and endurance in present circumstances while assuring readers that God's good agenda will ultimately triumph
- The Judaism that emerged after the Babylonian exile was fundamentally different from pre-exilic Judaism, setting crucial groundwork for the world Jesus would enter

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Definition of Apocalyptic Literature

Apocalyptic literature is a specific genre that utilizes symbols and images to convey hope to its present-day audience. This definition is critical because it corrects common misunderstandings about books like Zechariah, Daniel, Ezekiel, and Revelation. The primary function is not to provide detailed blueprints or timelines for the future or "end times," but rather to encourage and inspire people facing current struggles. While God may choose to fulfill these prophecies in ways that align with the imagery used, that fulfillment is not the literature's primary purpose.

##### Structure of Apocalyptic Prophecy

Apocalyptic literature typically follows a predictable pattern:

1. **Opening visions and images** that encourage faithfulness and endurance in present trials
2. **Symbolic representations** of God, His people, the trials facing the audience, and God's character
3. **Closing proclamations** that assert hope - a new kingdom, new reality, and new ruler is coming
4. **Call to obedience** - the message emphasizes that if people will walk faithfully through current circumstances, God's good purposes will prevail

This structure serves a pastoral function, helping communities maintain hope and faithfulness during extended periods of difficulty.

##### Historical Context of Zechariah's Ministry

Zechariah prophesied to the remnant that had returned to Jerusalem from Babylonian exile. These returnees faced the enormous challenge of rebuilding their homeland while living under Persian imperial control. The psychological and spiritual weight of trying to restore "the glory of the good old days" while lacking political autonomy created a need for consistent encouragement.

The podcast suggests Zechariah and Haggai were likely toddlers when the first waves of returnees arrived in Jerusalem. They grew up experiencing firsthand the "mess and struggle" of the rebuilding process. Both prophets were probably trained together in what might be thought of as "prophet school" - prophets didn't simply wake up one morning with their calling but underwent formal training. This shared background and possibly close friendship gave their complementary ministries even greater significance.

##### The Theme of Humble Kingship

A recurring theme in Hebrew prophecy is that God's deliverance comes through unexpected, humble means rather than through military might and conventional power. This theme appears in:

- **David's story** - the youngest of eight sons, a shepherd from Judah, not the impressive Saul
- **Isaiah's Suffering Servant** (Third Isaiah) - deliverance through suffering and humility
- **Micah's prophecy** - "But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, least among the clans of Judah, out of you..." pointing to a king from humble origins
- **Zechariah 9:9-10** - a king riding on a donkey, not a warhorse

This theme establishes a pattern that finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus's ministry, teaching that God's kingdom operates on different principles than earthly empires. True power comes through humility, service, and obedience to God rather than through force and domination.

##### Living Faithfully Within Empire

A crucial but often overlooked aspect of Zechariah's message is instruction on how to live faithfully under imperial rule. The remnant in Jerusalem wasn't politically autonomous - they lived under Persian control. Zechariah's prophecy encouraged them that if they could "walk obediently within empire," persevering in faithfulness despite not having their own king or full independence, then eventually God would bring their promised king through divine providence.

This has profound implications for how we understand the political dimensions of biblical prophecy. Rather than promising immediate political revolution or military overthrow of oppressors, Zechariah taught a different path: faithful obedience in present circumstances, trusting God's timing and methods for bringing about His kingdom.

##### Connection to Revelation

The episode emphasizes that nearly all apocalyptic images in Zechariah reappear in the book of Revelation, demonstrating the deep continuity between Hebrew Scripture and the New Testament. Specific parallels include:

- **Man among myrtle trees** (Zechariah) / **Man among lampstands** (Revelation)
- **Horns scattering Israel** / **Trumpets and horns** in Revelation
- **Measuring line for Jerusalem** / **Measuring rod** in Revelation
- **Clean garments of the high priest** / **Multitude in white robes**
- **Scrolls** appear in both texts
- **Woman in a basket** / **Woman on a beast**
- **Four horses drawing chariots** / **Four horsemen** imagery

This connection demonstrates that Revelation wasn't introducing entirely new, mysterious imagery, but was drawing on centuries of established prophetic tradition. Understanding Zechariah and other Hebrew prophets provides essential context for interpreting Revelation. The hosts suggest that much hand-wringing over Revelation's difficulty could be resolved by becoming more familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures that John quoted extensively.

##### Post-Exilic Transformation

The episode concludes by noting that the Judaism emerging after Babylonian exile was fundamentally different from what existed before. This wasn't merely a restoration project but a transformation. God's promise in Haggai to "shake the heavens and the earth" wasn't hyperbole - significant theological and practical changes occurred that would "set the stage for Jesus in a really big way." This rebuilt religious framework became the context into which Jesus was born and ministered.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Palm Sunday and Zechariah 9:9-10

The most familiar application of Zechariah discussed in the episode is Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. Gospel writers explicitly connected Jesus riding into Jerusalem on a donkey with Zechariah's prophecy. However, the episode challenges us to understand this in its full context:

**Original Context**: Zechariah encouraged the struggling remnant that if they could persevere faithfully under Persian rule, their king would eventually come - not through military conquest but through God's providence and humble means.

**Jesus's Application**: By riding on a donkey, Jesus wasn't just fulfilling a prediction; He was embodying the very principle Zechariah taught - that God's kingdom comes through humility and servanthood, not military might. He was declaring Himself king while simultaneously redefining what kingship means.

**Modern Application**: This challenges contemporary readers to examine whether we expect God's work to come through impressive displays of power or through humble, often overlooked means. Are we looking for "warhorses" or "donkeys"?

##### Reading Prophetic Literature with Proper Tools

The hosts acknowledge that they've transitioned from covering every story in detail (as they did in earlier Genesis episodes) to discussing entire prophetic books in single episodes. This shift reflects the nature of the material and their educational philosophy. Their goal isn't to explain everything but to provide enough context and tools that listeners can read the prophets themselves with understanding.

**Application**: This models an important educational principle - sometimes the best teaching equips people to learn independently rather than providing exhaustive information. The episode serves as an example of how providing historical context, defining literary genres, and pointing out key themes can "turn the lights on" for readers who previously found prophetic literature confusing.

##### Encouragement During Long Seasons of Struggle

Zechariah's ministry lasted decades because the remnant needed ongoing encouragement. Rebuilding wasn't a quick project followed by immediate blessing. It was "a long season" requiring perseverance through continued difficulty.

**Application**: This speaks to modern experiences of long-term challenges - whether personal, communal, or related to faith development. Just as the remnant needed repeated encouragement through apocalyptic visions reminding them of God's ultimate purposes, contemporary believers facing extended trials benefit from revisiting biblical promises and maintaining long-term perspective. Quick fixes and immediate results aren't always how God works; sometimes faithfulness means sustained obedience over many years.

##### Understanding Scripture Through Scripture

The connection between Zechariah and Revelation demonstrates how Scripture interprets Scripture. John didn't create new imagery from scratch; he drew from the prophetic tradition he inherited.

**Application**: This suggests that difficulty understanding later biblical texts (like Revelation) often stems from unfamiliarity with earlier texts they reference. The solution isn't seeking entirely new interpretive frameworks but becoming more deeply acquainted with the Hebrew Scriptures. This has implications for Bible study methods - reading Scripture in isolation from its broader biblical context will inevitably lead to confusion.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Detailed Study of Zechariah's Visions

The episode provides an overview but doesn't examine Zechariah's specific visions in detail. Further study could explore:

- The vision of the man among the myrtle trees (Zechariah 1)
- The vision of four horns and four craftsmen (Zechariah 1)
- The vision of the measuring line (Zechariah 2)
- The vision of Joshua the high priest (Zechariah 3)
- The golden lampstand and two olive trees (Zechariah 4)
- The flying scroll and woman in a basket (Zechariah 5)
- The four chariots (Zechariah 6)

Understanding how each vision would have spoken to the remnant's specific circumstances would deepen appreciation for Zechariah's pastoral wisdom.

##### Comparison of Haggai and Zechariah's Approaches

While both prophets ministered to the same community during overlapping time periods, their approaches differed significantly. Haggai's brief, direct messages contrasted with Zechariah's decades of image-rich prophecy. Further exploration could examine:

- How their different styles complemented each other
- Whether their messages addressed different aspects of the community's needs
- How their possibly shared training background influenced their distinct approaches
- What we can learn about diverse communication styles in ministry

##### The Development of Apocalyptic Literature

Zechariah is described as "one of the most apocalyptic prophets," but apocalyptic literature appears in various forms throughout Scripture (Daniel, Ezekiel, portions of Isaiah, Revelation). Deeper study could trace:

- The historical development of apocalyptic as a literary genre
- Why this genre particularly flourished during and after the exile
- How apocalyptic literature functioned in other ancient Near Eastern contexts
- The relationship between apocalyptic and wisdom literature

##### Post-Exilic Judaism's Transformation

The episode notes that post-exilic Judaism was "fundamentally different" from pre-exilic Judaism. This transformation deserves extensive exploration:

- What specific theological developments occurred during the exile?
- How did synagogue worship develop alongside/instead of temple worship?
- What role did scribes and Pharisees emerge to play?
- How did understanding of Torah and its application change?
- What apocalyptic and messianic expectations developed during this period?
- How did these changes create the religious landscape Jesus entered?

##### Kingship Theology Throughout Scripture

The theme of humble kingship traces through multiple biblical texts. A comprehensive study could examine:

- How Israel's request for "a king like all the nations" (1 Samuel 8) contrasted with God's ideal
- The Davidic covenant and its emphasis on different kind of kingship
- Prophetic critiques of kingship and visions of ideal rulers
- How Jesus's teaching about the kingdom of God both fulfilled and subverted expectations
- Implications for Christian understanding of authority and leadership

##### Hermeneutical Approach to Prophecy

The episode's interpretation of Zechariah 9:9-10 demonstrates a hermeneutical principle: understanding original context doesn't negate later application or fulfillment. This raises important questions:

- How do we hold together original meaning and later Christian interpretation?
- What is the relationship between what a prophet intended and how their words were ultimately fulfilled?
- How does understanding original context enrich rather than diminish christological readings?
- What guidelines help distinguish legitimate typological interpretation from eisegesis?

##### The Use of Zechariah in the New Testament

Beyond Palm Sunday, other New Testament passages quote or allude to Zechariah:

- The 30 pieces of silver (Zechariah 11:12-13; Matthew 27:9-10)
- "They will look on me, the one they have pierced" (Zechariah 12:10; John 19:37)
- The stricken shepherd and scattered sheep (Zechariah 13:7; Matthew 26:31)

Studying how New Testament authors employed Zechariah would illuminate early Christian interpretive methods and their understanding of Jesus's identity and mission.

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Define apocalyptic literature according to the episode and explain why this definition matters for interpreting books like Zechariah and Revelation.** What are the potential problems with viewing apocalyptic literature primarily as detailed predictions of future end-times events?

2. **Describe the historical context of Zechariah's audience - the post-exilic remnant in Jerusalem.** What specific challenges did they face, and how did Zechariah's prophecies address their situation? Why was ongoing encouragement over decades necessary?

3. **Explain the theme of "humble kingship" as it appears throughout Hebrew prophecy.** Provide at least three biblical examples of this theme, and discuss how understanding this pattern enriches interpretation of Zechariah 9:9-10 and Jesus's triumphal entry into Jerusalem.

4. **The episode states that Zechariah's message taught the remnant how to "live obediently within empire."** What does this mean, and how does it challenge common assumptions about biblical prophecy's relationship to political power and revolution?

5. **List at least five specific connections between imagery in Zechariah and imagery in the book of Revelation.** What do these connections teach us about how to interpret Revelation, and what broader principle about biblical interpretation do they illustrate?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This episode on Zechariah provides crucial tools for understanding apocalyptic literature throughout Scripture. Rather than viewing books like Zechariah or Revelation as mysterious coded messages about the distant future, we learn they were primarily pastoral texts offering hope to struggling communities through symbolic imagery. Zechariah ministered for decades to the post-exilic remnant, encouraging them to persevere faithfully under Persian rule with the promise that God would eventually bring their king through humble means, not military might.

The famous prophecy of a king riding on a donkey originally encouraged the remnant to trust God's providence rather than seeking political revolution - a message that gained profound new meaning when Jesus embodied this principle on Palm Sunday. The deep connections between Zechariah's imagery and the book of Revelation demonstrate that New Testament authors were steeped in Hebrew Scripture, reminding us that difficulty understanding later biblical texts often stems from unfamiliarity with earlier ones they reference.

Perhaps most significantly, this episode highlights that the Judaism emerging after Babylon's exile was fundamentally transformed, setting the stage for Jesus in ways we'll explore further in Session 3. The rebuilding project wasn't merely restoration but transformation, and the apocalyptic hope Zechariah proclaimed - that faithful perseverance leads to God's ultimate triumph - remains a vital message for communities facing long seasons of struggle today.

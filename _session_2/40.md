### BEMA Episode 40: One Story, Two Sources - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode introduces a critical framework for understanding the biblical historical record of the United Kingdom of Israel by examining the two distinct literary sources that tell this history: Samuel/Kings and Chronicles. The hosts explain why this section of scripture (1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles) often feels confusing to readers and provide a framework for understanding how these books relate to each other as two perspectives on the same historical period.

#### Key Takeaways

- The biblical narrative of Israel's monarchy is told through two distinct sources: Samuel/Kings and Chronicles
- Samuel/Kings functions as "agenda-driven headlines from Israel" - written closer to the events being described (approximately 800-1000 BC)
- Chronicles serves as a "documentary perspective from Judah" - written much later (approximately 4th-5th century BC) with historical hindsight
- Ancient Eastern history is fundamentally different from modern Western history - it is "prophetic," meaning it tells the story in a way meant to compel readers to action rather than simply recording facts with precision
- In the Hebrew Bible (TaNaKh), Samuel and Kings are classified as "prophets" (Nevi'im), not just historical books, indicating their prophetic purpose
- Chronicles is placed in the "writings" (Ketuvim) and is the final book of the Hebrew scriptures, ending with hope rather than the curse that ends the Christian Old Testament arrangement
- Understanding these two sources helps readers navigate what can otherwise feel like confusing repetition and flashbacks in the biblical text
- Both accounts are accurate but serve different purposes and are shaped by their different historical contexts and perspectives

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Overarching Biblical Narrative: Empire vs. Shalom

Before diving into the two sources, the episode reviews the larger biblical story as a tale of two competing kingdoms or narratives:
- **Empire**: represents self-preservation, the order of death, oppressive systems
- **Shalom**: represents self-sacrifice, the order of life, redemptive partnership with God

This conflict between Empire and Shalom runs throughout the entire biblical narrative from Genesis through the New Testament and provides the thematic framework for understanding Israel's history.

##### Review of the Story So Far

The episode provides an extensive review of the biblical narrative leading up to Samuel/Kings:

**Genesis**: Sets up the narrative with chapters 1-11 describing who God is and how the world works, then applies these principles through the patriarchal family (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph)

**Exodus**: God rescues Israel from Empire (Egypt), marries them at Mount Sinai in covenant, and they build the tabernacle (which functions as a honeymoon suite and retelling of Genesis 1-3)

**Leviticus**: God reveals what it means to be "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation" (Exodus 19) through:
- The "priest sandwich" structure: priesthood instructions, how-to-live laws in the middle, what to do when priests fail
- Instructions for atonement, living holy lives, celebrating feasts, and caring for the oppressed
- A complete blueprint for priestly living

**Numbers**: The honeymoon period where Israel learns to know their divine spouse in the wilderness

**Deuteronomy**: The call to remember their humble beginnings so they will notice and care for others in similar circumstances

**Joshua**: Not just conquest, but God strategically placing His partner people at the crossroads of the earth, in the middle of the action where they can participate in redeeming an oppressive world

**Judges**: Not a "sin cycle" but a "redemption cycle" demonstrating God's bottomless patience and persistent pursuit of His people through repeated deliverance

**Ruth**: A zoom-in on righteousness in the midst of the Judges period, showing people trying to live faithfully

##### The Two Sources Framework

**Source 1: Samuel/Kings (The Red Source)**
- **Perspective**: Written from Israel's viewpoint, close to the events
- **Timing**: Possibly one of the first Old Testament books written (approximately 800-1000 BC)
- **Style**: "Agenda-driven headlines from Israel"
- **Classification**: Part of the Nevi'im (Prophets) in the Hebrew Bible
- **Purpose**: Prophetic history meant to compel readers to action through how it tells the story
- **Character**: Reads like current events reported with passion and agenda rather than detached journalism

**Source 2: Chronicles (The Green Source)**
- **Perspective**: Written from Judah's viewpoint, centuries after the events
- **Timing**: Much later composition (approximately 4th-5th century BC, possibly 300-500 years after Samuel/Kings)
- **Style**: "Documentary perspective from Judah"
- **Classification**: Part of the Ketuvim (Writings) in the Hebrew Bible, positioned as the final book
- **Purpose**: Looking back with historical perspective and hindsight
- **Character**: Shaped by centuries of reflection, tells the same story but with different emphases based on what history has revealed

##### Ancient vs. Modern History Writing

A crucial concept for understanding these sources is recognizing that ancient Eastern history writing operates on fundamentally different principles than modern Western history:

**Modern Western History**:
- Committed to precision and factual accuracy
- Attempts objective, detached reporting
- Prioritizes getting every detail correct
- Resembles journalistic fact-checking

**Ancient Eastern History**:
- Prophetic in nature - meant to deliver a message
- Tells accurate details in a way that stirs and moves readers
- Less concerned with precision than with compelling readers to action
- History serves as a mouthpiece for God to speak to current circumstances

The example given is David and Goliath: the question isn't primarily about historical accuracy but about what message the story is meant to convey to its audience.

##### The TaNaKh Structure

Understanding the Hebrew Bible structure illuminates how these sources function:

**TaNaKh** is an acronym for the three sections:
- **T** = Torah (Law): Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy
- **N** = Nevi'im (Prophets): Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, plus what we typically call prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets)
- **K** = Ketuvim (Writings): Includes Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, Chronicles

**Key observations**:
- Samuel and Kings appear in the Prophets section, indicating they are meant to be read as prophetic history
- Chronicles appears in the Writings section and concludes the entire Hebrew Bible
- This differs significantly from Christian Old Testament arrangement, which ends with Malachi and a curse rather than Chronicles and hope

##### The Reorganization of the Canon

The Christian church reorganized the books of the Hebrew Bible when creating the Old Testament:
- Supposedly arranged by "genre" (a Western category)
- However, the reorganization coincided with rampant anti-Semitism
- The Hebrew Bible ends with 2 Chronicles, which closes with hope and God's promise to restore His people
- The Christian Old Testament ends with Malachi, which closes with a curse
- This arrangement sets up a Christian worldview where Judaism is failed and cursed, awaiting Jesus as the solution

##### The Vietnam War Analogy

To illustrate the difference between the two sources, the episode uses a modern parallel:

**Headlines from the Vietnam War era** = Samuel/Kings
- Written during or shortly after the events
- Accurate but shaped by immediate context and perspective
- Agenda-driven based on current concerns
- Limited by proximity to events

**A Netflix documentary made in the last decade about the Vietnam War** = Chronicles
- Written long after the events
- Still accurate but shaped by historical perspective
- Benefits from hindsight and understanding of long-term consequences
- Tells the story differently based on what time has revealed

Both are accurate, but the passage of time dramatically affects what is emphasized and how the story is told.

##### Why This Section Feels Confusing

The episode identifies several reasons readers struggle with this portion of scripture:

1. **Volume of short stories**: Many brief accounts of numerous kings and their disobedience (with few exceptions)
2. **North/South confusion**: After the kingdom divides, it's difficult to track which king belongs to which kingdom (Israel vs. Judah) and how they relate
3. **Apparent repetition**: Reading through a Protestant Bible linearly, you encounter Saul and David in Samuel, then Solomon and subsequent kings in Kings, then suddenly you're back to Saul and David in Chronicles - creating confusion about whether you're reading flashbacks or if you missed a transition
4. **Lack of explanation**: Many readers have never had the relationship between these books adequately explained

#### Examples & Applications

##### Real-World Example: Understanding Confusing Texts

Many readers experience "glazed eyes" when reaching 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, and 1 & 2 Chronicles. With the two-sources framework:
- Recognize you're encountering two different tellings of the same period
- Samuel/Kings offers the "hot take" close to events
- Chronicles offers the reflective, long-view perspective
- Both contribute to understanding, like hearing about an event from multiple witnesses

##### Practical Application: History as Prophetic

When reading any biblical history:
- Ask not just "what happened?" but "what is God saying through how this is told?"
- Consider what action the storyteller wants to compel in readers
- Recognize that accuracy doesn't require modern precision - the message matters most
- Look for the agenda or purpose behind how events are presented

##### Application to Modern Context

Just as the Vietnam War can be understood through both contemporary headlines and retrospective documentaries:
- Contemporary accounts offer immediacy, urgency, and the perspective of those living through events
- Historical accounts offer context, consequences, and the wisdom of hindsight
- Both are valuable; neither is "wrong"
- The same principle applies to how we understand current events - immediate reactions vs. historical reflection both have roles

##### The David and Goliath Question

The episode hints at a key application explored in discussion groups: Is the David and Goliath story primarily about historical accuracy or about something else? This question applies to all biblical narratives:
- Ancient readers cared more about meaning than precision
- The story's purpose drives how it's told
- Multiple tellings can each be "true" while emphasizing different aspects

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Detailed Authorship Debates**: Who wrote Samuel/Kings and Chronicles? When exactly were they composed? What specific historical circumstances prompted their writing?

2. **Literary Analysis**: What specific differences appear between the two sources' accounts of the same events? How do their agendas manifest in their storytelling choices?

3. **The Dating Question**: What evidence supports the dating of these books? How does this dating affect our understanding of their purpose?

4. **Canon Formation**: How and why did the Christian church reorganize the Hebrew Bible? What were the theological and political factors at play?

5. **Prophetic History**: What does it mean practically for history to be "prophetic"? How does this change our reading approach?

6. **The Divided Kingdom Period**: How do you track the northern and southern kingdoms and their various kings? What patterns emerge?

7. **David and Goliath**: What is the deeper meaning of this story beyond surface-level history? How does understanding it as prophetic history change its interpretation?

8. **Anti-Semitism and Canon**: How did anti-Semitism shape Christian interpretation and arrangement of the Hebrew scriptures? What has been lost or distorted through this lens?

9. **Chronicles' Ending**: What is the specific message of hope that ends Chronicles and the Hebrew Bible? Why was this changed in Christian arrangement?

10. **The Writings (Ketuvim)**: Why was Daniel considered a "writing" rather than a prophet in the Hebrew Bible? What does this reveal about Jewish categorization?

11. **Application to Other Biblical Books**: Does this two-source principle apply elsewhere in scripture? Are there other examples of multiple perspectives on the same events?

12. **Torah Dating**: If Samuel/Kings is among the earliest written books, when were the books of Moses (Torah) written? How does this affect traditional assumptions?

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Compare and Contrast**: What are the key differences between Samuel/Kings and Chronicles in terms of timing, perspective, and purpose? How does understanding them as "headlines" vs. "documentary" help you read them?

2. **TaNaKh Structure**: Explain the three-part structure of the Hebrew Bible (TaNaKh) and why it matters that Samuel/Kings appears in the Prophets section while Chronicles appears in the Writings section. What does this tell us about how these books should be read?

3. **Ancient vs. Modern History**: How does ancient Eastern history writing differ from modern Western history writing? Why is this distinction crucial for correctly interpreting biblical historical narratives?

4. **Prophetic History**: What does it mean to say that "history is prophetic" in the Hebrew understanding? How does this differ from viewing history merely as factual record-keeping?

5. **Canon Reorganization**: Why did the Christian church reorganize the Hebrew Bible when creating the Old Testament, and what theological implications resulted from ending with Malachi's curse rather than Chronicles' hope?

#### Personalized Summary

Episode 40 provides an essential framework for navigating one of the most confusing sections of scripture. The key insight is recognizing that 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, and 1 & 2 Chronicles aren't simply repetitive or disorganized - they represent two distinct sources telling the story of Israel's monarchy from different temporal perspectives and with different purposes.

Samuel/Kings offers "agenda-driven headlines from Israel," written close to the events (around 800-1000 BC) and classified as prophetic literature in the Hebrew Bible. Chronicles provides a "documentary perspective from Judah," written centuries later (around 4th-5th century BC) with the benefit of historical hindsight and placed as the concluding book of the Hebrew scriptures.

Both sources are accurate, but accuracy in ancient Eastern history looks different from modern Western precision. Ancient historians told the story in ways meant to stir readers to action - history was prophetic, meant to convey messages about how to live, not just record what happened. This explains why the same period can be told differently by the two sources without either being "wrong."

Understanding this framework transforms a confusing section of scripture into a rich, multi-dimensional account where the "hot takes" of Samuel/Kings complement the reflective wisdom of Chronicles. Together, they provide both the immediacy of those living through monarchical Israel's triumphs and tragedies and the sober assessment of what it all meant in the long run.

This episode also reveals how the Christian reorganization of the Hebrew Bible - ending with Malachi's curse rather than Chronicles' hope - has shaped Christian theology in ways that may not align with the original Jewish understanding. The TaNaKh structure, which places historical books like Samuel and Kings among the prophets and ends the entire collection with Chronicles' hopeful promise of restoration, invites a different reading than our familiar Old Testament arrangement.

As we move forward into the detailed study of Israel's kings, this framework will prove invaluable for understanding not just what happened, but why these events are being told the way they are and what message they're meant to convey to readers then and now.

### BEMA Episode 59: Obadiah — Petra

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode explores the book of Obadiah, the shortest prophetic book in the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh). The prophet Obadiah delivers God's condemnation against the nation of Edom for their mistreatment of their brother nation, Judah, during a time of crisis. The episode examines the historical relationship between Edom (descendants of Esau) and Judah (descendants of Jacob), the geographical significance of Petra as Edom's rock fortress, and the universal expectation that all people treat one another with dignity and care.

#### Key Takeaways

- Obadiah is unique among the prophets because it is addressed to a nation outside the covenant relationship with Israel (Edom), not to Israel or Judah directly
- Edom (descendants of Esau) and Judah (descendants of Jacob) shared a fraternal relationship that carried special covenantal obligations
- God expects all people, not just covenant Israel, to treat others with basic human dignity and care for those in need
- Standing aloof and doing nothing while others suffer is itself a condemnation, but taking advantage of suffering people is even worse
- Edom's pride in their impenetrable rock fortresses (like Petra) led to a false sense of security that God would dismantle
- The Edomites (later known as Idumeans/Nabataeans) were wealthy spice traders who built remarkable cities like Petra, and their descendants include Herod the Great
- Even in judgment, God offers hope and restoration to Jacob (Judah), promising they will possess their inheritance

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Identity and Location of Edom

Edom was the nation descended from Esau, the twin brother of Jacob. Unlike other neighboring nations such as Philistia, Phoenicia, or even the more distantly related Moab and Ammon, Edom had a unique fraternal relationship with Israel and Judah. Both nations were "children of Abraham," making their relationship more than merely political—it was covenantal and familial.

Geographically, Edom was located southeast of Judah, positioned strategically along the southern spice trade route. This location allowed them to capitalize on trade and accumulate significant wealth. The Edomites were originally nomadic people, similar to their Judean brothers, but at some point in history they transitioned to building sophisticated cities—a transition that remains mysterious to historians given their lack of prior experience in urban architecture.

##### The Historical Development: Edomites to Idumeans to Nabataeans

Over time, the descendants of Esau became known as the Idumeans, and later became associated with (or synonymous with) the Nabataeans. Historians often refer to them as the "Idumean-Nabataeans," though much about this transition remains debated and unclear. What is clear is that these people became some of the wealthiest in the ancient world due to their control of the spice trade.

The Nabataeans eventually built remarkable cities carved into rock faces, with Petra being the most famous example. These rock fortresses served as natural defenses—narrow passageways through rocks made it nearly impossible for armies to penetrate. The Nabataeans were so well protected that even Rome struggled to conquer them due to the difficulty of getting water to armies for sustained sieges in the remote desert locations.

##### Petra: The Rock Fortress

Petra, located in modern-day Jordan, exemplifies the Edomite pride and security mentioned in Obadiah. The city features elaborate facades carved into rock faces, most famously the temple facade made iconic by Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. These facades, created during the Hellenistic period, demonstrate remarkable architectural sophistication.

The rock fortresses created a sense of invulnerability in the Edomites. They believed their geographic position and architectural achievements made them impenetrable. This pride becomes a central issue in Obadiah's prophecy, as God declares that no matter how high they build or how secure they feel, He can bring them down.

##### The Sin of Edom: Escalating Betrayal

Obadiah outlines a progression of sins committed by Edom against their brother Judah during Judah's time of crisis (the Babylonian invasion):

1. **Standing aloof**: Doing nothing while strangers carried off Judah's wealth—passive indifference to suffering
2. **Gloating**: Taking pleasure in Judah's misfortune and destruction
3. **Boasting**: Speaking arrogantly during Judah's day of trouble
4. **Marching through gates**: Entering Jerusalem during disaster
5. **Seizing wealth**: Taking advantage by looting during calamity
6. **Waiting at crossroads**: Actively cutting down fugitives trying to escape
7. **Handing over survivors**: Betraying those who survived to their enemies

The image presented is of Judah fleeing from Babylon, running to their brother nation Edom for help, and instead of receiving aid, being turned away—or worse, being pointed out to their pursuers. This represents the ultimate betrayal of familial and neighborly obligations.

##### Universal Expectations of Human Dignity

A crucial theological point in Obadiah is that God holds all nations, not just covenant Israel, accountable for how they treat people. Even though Edom was not part of the covenant community in the same way as Israel and Judah, God still expected them to demonstrate basic human decency and care for their brother.

This establishes a universal moral expectation: all people are responsible for how they treat others, especially the vulnerable and those in crisis. The prophet reveals that God cares deeply about people and becomes furious when the powerful take advantage of those in need.

##### The Day of the Lord and Restoration

Despite the harsh judgment pronounced on Edom, Obadiah concludes with hope for Jacob (Judah). The phrase "the day of the Lord" appears, indicating divine intervention and judgment that will affect all nations. While Edom faces complete destruction with "no survivors," Jacob will experience deliverance and will "possess his inheritance."

This pattern of judgment followed by restoration is consistent throughout the prophetic literature. Even in the darkest moments of exile and defeat, God promises that His covenant with His people will not be broken, and they will be restored to their land and identity.

##### Connection to the New Testament Era

The episode notes that Herod the Great, who plays a significant role in the New Testament narrative, had his roots in the Idumean-Nabataeans. This historical connection helps explain Herod's character, wealth, and relationship with the Jewish people. Understanding Herod as an Idumean (Edomite) adds layers of meaning to his interactions with the Jewish nation and his role in the Gospel accounts.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Real-World Examples from the Text

**The Babylonian Crisis**: When Babylon invaded Judah, the Edomites not only refused to help their brother nation but actively participated in the disaster. They looted, captured fugitives, and handed survivors over to the enemy. This historical betrayal serves as the concrete example that provokes God's judgment.

**Petra as a False Security**: The rock fortresses of Edom, particularly Petra, represent human pride in self-sufficiency and security apart from God. Despite their impressive architecture and seemingly impenetrable defenses, God declares He can bring them down from any height. This mirrors the biblical theme found in the Tower of Babel and other narratives where human pride leads to downfall.

**The Grape Pickers Analogy**: Obadiah uses the image of grape pickers who normally leave some grapes behind, and thieves who only take what they want. The implication is that Edom's destruction will be total—more complete than even the worst robbery or harvest. This hyperbolic language emphasizes the severity of God's judgment.

##### Contemporary Applications

**Standing Aloof**: In modern contexts, this speaks to the sin of indifference—seeing suffering and doing nothing. Whether it's ignoring homelessness, turning away from refugee crises, or failing to speak up for the marginalized, passive indifference to suffering is itself a moral failure.

**Taking Advantage of Crisis**: Throughout history and in contemporary society, there are those who exploit disasters for personal gain—price gouging during emergencies, predatory lending after natural disasters, or political opportunism during crises. Obadiah condemns this exploitation as particularly offensive to God.

**Family and Neighborly Obligations**: The special relationship between Edom and Judah as brothers raises questions about our obligations to those closest to us. How do we treat family members in crisis? How do communities respond when neighbors face hardship?

**False Security**: Just as Edom trusted in their rock fortresses, modern people place trust in financial security, political power, military might, or social status. The message of Obadiah challenges any sense of invulnerability or self-sufficiency apart from proper relationship with God and others.

**Universal Moral Standards**: The fact that God judges Edom (outside the covenant) for their treatment of people establishes that moral accountability exists for all people, not just religious believers. This supports a universal ethic of human dignity and care for the vulnerable.

#### Personalized Summary

The book of Obadiah delivers a powerful message about universal human responsibility and the serious consequences of betraying those in need. At its core, this shortest of prophetic books addresses the people of Edom—descendants of Esau and therefore brothers to the people of Judah—who not only failed to help their relatives during the Babylonian crisis but actively participated in their suffering. The progression from standing aloof and doing nothing, to gloating, to actively cutting down fugitives and handing over survivors, represents an escalating betrayal that provokes God's fierce judgment.

What makes Obadiah particularly significant is that it establishes God's moral expectations extend beyond the covenant community. Even though Edom was not Israel, God still held them accountable for basic human decency and care for their brother. This reveals a universal ethical standard: all people, regardless of their religious or covenantal status, are responsible for how they treat others—especially the vulnerable and those in crisis.

The image of Petra—the magnificent rock fortress that seemed impenetrable—serves as a symbol of false security and pride. The Edomites believed their geographical position and architectural achievements made them invulnerable, but God declares that no height is too great for Him to bring down. This challenges any human confidence built on wealth, power, or strategic advantage apart from right relationship with God and proper treatment of people.

While the judgment on Edom is severe and final, the prophecy concludes with hope for Jacob. Despite their current suffering under Babylonian oppression, God promises that Jacob will possess their inheritance and experience deliverance. This pattern of judgment followed by restoration is consistent throughout prophetic literature and points toward God's ultimate faithfulness to His covenant promises.

For contemporary readers, Obadiah raises challenging questions about our own complicity in suffering, whether through active harm or passive indifference. It calls us to examine how we respond when others face crisis, how we treat those who are vulnerable, and whether we take advantage of difficult situations for our own gain. The prophet's message remains clear: God cares deeply about people, and He expects all of us—not just the religiously committed—to demonstrate that same care through our actions toward one another.

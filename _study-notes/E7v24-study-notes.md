### BEMA Episode 7: The Preface - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Episode 7: The Preface (E7v24)**  
An analysis of Genesis 1-11 as the "preface" to God's narrative in Scripture, examining how eight key stories form a complex chiastic structure that invites readers to trust God's story and reframe their understanding of God, humanity, and creation.

#### Key Takeaways

- Genesis 1-11 functions as a "preface" to God's story, providing essential backstory and worldview framework
- Eight stories in Genesis 1-11 form a remarkable chiasm of chiasms (ABCD-ABCD structure)
- The center of this grand chiasm is Noah's name, meaning "comfort" and pointing to rest/Sabbath
- Each story contains problems, follows chiastic structure, and addresses themes of goodness vs. tragedy, stopping vs. obsession, rest vs. mistrust
- The preface invites readers to "Trust the Story" - trusting that creation is good, God loves creation, and there is enough
- God is consistently portrayed as loving and patient throughout these stories, not the angry Old Testament God of popular misconception
- The literary sophistication suggests divine inspiration beyond human capability alone

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Three-Part Structure of Scripture

**Preface (Genesis 1-11)**: High-level backstory, origin stories, meta-level conversations about God, humanity, and their relationships. Comparable to Tolkien's preface in Lord of the Rings that introduces Middle Earth's unique world.

**Introduction (Genesis 12-50)**: Introduction to Abraham and the family of God, setting up the main story with key characters and plot elements.

**Narrative (Exodus-Revelation)**: The main story of God's work - exodus, deliverance, and salvation.

##### The Eight Stories and Their Patterns

1. **Creation** (Genesis 1) - Goodness, God knowing when to stop, invitation to rest
2. **Adam and Eve** (Genesis 2-3) - Tragedy, obsession with moving forward, mistrust
3. **Cain and Abel** (Genesis 4) - Tragedy, obsession, mistrust
4. **Genealogy** (Genesis 5)
5. **The Flood** (Genesis 6-9a) - Goodness reaffirmed, God knowing when to stop destroying, rest
6. **Noah's Curse** (Genesis 9b-10) - Tragedy, obsession, mistrust
7. **Tower of Babel** (Genesis 11a) - Tragedy, obsession, mistrust
8. **Genealogy** (Genesis 11b)

##### Chiastic Structure (ABCD-ABCD)

- A stories (Creation, Flood): Focus on God's goodness, knowing when to stop, rest
- B stories (Adam/Eve, Noah's Curse): Tragedy, obsession, mistrust
- C stories (Cain/Abel, Tower of Babel): Tragedy, obsession, mistrust, themes of wandering vs. settling
- D stories (Genealogies): Connecting passages

##### The Central Message: "Trust the Story"

Located at the literal center of the grand chiasm is Genesis 5:28-29, where Noah's name (meaning "comfort") is revealed with the promise that "He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed." This points to the Sabbath principle and the call to trust rather than strive.

##### Theological Reframing

The preface challenges common assumptions about:

- **God's character**: Not an angry Old Testament God, but consistently loving and patient
- **Humanity's nature**: Not simply fallen, but invited into relationship and right response
- **Creation's status**: Fundamentally good, with enough provision
- **God's relationship to the world**: Active, caring, redemptive rather than distant or wrathful

#### Examples & Applications

##### Literary Parallel

Just as Tolkien's Lord of the Rings requires a preface to understand Middle Earth's unique rules and inhabitants (hobbits, elves, orcs), Genesis 1-11 provides the necessary worldview framework for understanding the rest of Scripture.

##### Teaching Moment

Marty's experience with student Paris Shewey demonstrates the power of discovery-based learning. When Paris observed that all the individual chiasms together formed a larger chiasm, it led to a breakthrough moment that revealed the sophisticated literary structure of the text.

##### God's Patience with Cain

Rather than immediate judgment, God sits with Cain, pleads with him, and explains that his position toward Cain hasn't changed despite the rejected sacrifice. This exemplifies the loving character revealed throughout the preface.

##### The Flood as Salvation

While surface reading suggests God's wrath in destroying the world, deeper analysis reveals God's love in saving the world and knowing when to stop destroying - paralleling the creation account where God knew when to stop creating.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Chiastic Analysis Practice

- Examine the chiastic structures in Cain/Abel and Noah's curse stories that weren't fully explored in the episode
- Compare the parallel themes between Tower of Babel and Cain/Abel (wandering vs. settling)
- Analyze how genealogies function as connecting tissue in the larger structure

##### Theological Implications

- Explore how this reframing of Genesis 1-11 impacts understanding of human nature and original sin
- Investigate the Sabbath theology embedded throughout these narratives
- Study how "trusting the story" applies to contemporary faith and practice

##### Literary and Hermeneutical Study

- Research other examples of chiasm of chiasms in ancient literature
- Examine how recognizing literary structures affects biblical interpretation
- Explore the relationship between form and meaning in Hebrew narrative

##### Cross-Biblical Connections

- Trace how themes from the preface (rest, trust, God's character) develop throughout Scripture
- Study how Jesus and New Testament authors reference and fulfill preface themes
- Analyze how the preface connects to the ultimate resolution in Revelation

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Structural Understanding**: How do the eight stories of Genesis 1-11 form a chiasm of chiasms, and what is the significance of Noah's name appearing at the center of this structure?

2. **Thematic Analysis**: Compare and contrast the "A stories" (Creation, Flood) with the "B and C stories" (Adam/Eve, Cain/Abel, Noah's Curse, Tower of Babel) in terms of their themes of goodness vs. tragedy, stopping vs. obsession, and rest vs. mistrust.

3. **Theological Reframing**: How does viewing Genesis 1-11 as a "preface" challenge common assumptions about God's character, particularly the idea of an "angry Old Testament God"?

4. **Application**: What does it mean to "Trust the Story" in practical terms, and how does this central message of Genesis 1-11 apply to contemporary faith and living?

5. **Literary Sophistication**: What does the complex chiastic structure of Genesis 1-11 suggest about the nature of biblical inspiration and the relationship between human authorship and divine guidance?

#### Personal Summary

Genesis 1-11 emerges not as a collection of ancient myths or moral tales, but as a sophisticated literary masterpiece designed to reframe our entire understanding of reality. Like a skilled author's preface, these eight interconnected stories work together to challenge our assumptions about God, humanity, and creation itself. The discovery that these narratives form a complex chiasm of chiasms, with Noah's name - meaning "comfort" - at the very center, reveals an invitation that transcends time: to trust that God's story is good, that creation has enough, and that rest rather than striving is the path to true flourishing.

This preface doesn't simply tell us what happened "in the beginning," but invites us to see differently - to recognize a God who is consistently loving rather than wrathful, who sits with us in our struggles rather than condemning from a distance, and who calls us into the Sabbath rhythm of trust rather than the exhausting cycle of human effort. The literary brilliance of this structure, emerging through student discovery rather than scholarly analysis, reminds us that Scripture continues to reveal new depths to those who approach it with curiosity and openness. As we move forward in the biblical narrative, we carry with us this foundational invitation to trust the story - not just intellectually, but as a way of life that acknowledges God's fundamental goodness and provision in our world.

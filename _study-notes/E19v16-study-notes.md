### BEMA Episode 19: A Strengthened Heart - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 19 - A Strengthened Heart (2017)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Primary Source:** "The Exodus You Almost Passed Over" by Rabbi David Fohrman  

This episode explores the deeper meaning behind the Exodus story, examining why it's called "Passover," the significance of the firstborn, God's interaction with Pharaoh through the ten plagues, and Israel's calling as God's chosen people. The discussion challenges surface-level readings of the Exodus narrative to reveal profound theological truths about God's character, monotheism versus polytheism, and the nature of divine-human relationship.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Exodus story is fundamentally about God pursuing hearts, not just demonstrating power
- God's name reveals His timeless nature transcending all creation ("I was, I am, I will be")
- The ten plagues were a systematic dismantling of Egyptian polytheistic worldview
- Pharaoh's concern with precision over power reveals the difference between polytheistic and monotheistic understanding
- Israel is called to be God's "bechor" (firstborn) - not by birthright but by choice and mission
- The Passover represents spiritual rebirth, paralleling physical birth imagery
- Monotheism demands direct relationship with God, while polytheism creates indirect relationships
- Free will involves both understanding truth and choosing to act upon it with resolve

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Nature of God's Names

**El Shaddai vs. Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh:**
- **El Shaddai** - Interpreted by rabbis as "The One Who Said to His World Enough," emphasizing God's restraint and wisdom rather than unlimited power
- **Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh** - The tetragrammaton combining "I was," "I am," and "I will be," representing God's timeless nature that transcends human understanding
- The Monopoly board illustration: Humans trying to understand God are like game pieces trying to comprehend the game maker - we can only describe using limited earthly concepts

##### Monotheism vs. Polytheism Worldviews

**Polytheistic Framework:**
- Multiple gods representing natural forces in constant conflict
- Humans have indirect relationship with gods
- Power is expected but precision is impossible due to divine chaos
- Gods work against each other (fire god vs. ice god)

**Monotheistic Framework:**
- One Creator demands direct personal relationship
- Humans are part of God's unified divine plan
- Both power and precision are possible under one sovereign will
- Explains miraculous precision like fire within hail

##### The Hardening of Pharaoh's Heart

**Two Hebrew Concepts:**
- **Kavod** - To make stubborn/heavy; refusing to see or understand truth
- **Hazak** - To strengthen; acting with resolve despite understanding

**The Process:**
1. Early plagues: Pharaoh "stubborns" his heart (doesn't understand)
2. Middle plagues: God sometimes "stubborns" Pharaoh's heart to give him more opportunities
3. Later plagues: Pharaoh finally understands but chooses to "strengthen" his heart in defiance
4. God's goal: Genuine heart transformation, not mere compliance

##### Israel as God's Bechor (Firstborn)

**Firstborn Responsibilities:**
- Lead siblings in honoring the father
- Carry on the father's legacy and values
- Care for the entire household
- Receive double inheritance with double responsibility

**Israel's Calling:**
- Not firstborn by birth order but by choice and mission
- Called to be the message, not just carry the message
- Demonstrate God's character to the world
- Lead other nations toward understanding God

##### The Passover as Spiritual Birth

**Birth Imagery:**
- Blood on all four sides of door frames (threshold, lintel, doorposts)
- Leaving "in haste through a bloody door" parallels physical birth
- Red Sea as birth canal according to rabbinic interpretation
- Represents Israel's rebirth as God's chosen people
- Connects to Jesus' teaching about being "born again" (John 3)

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Apologetics and Worldview Engagement
Like Moses offering two different arguments to Pharaoh (relational invitation vs. consequence-based), modern believers must understand different worldviews to communicate effectively. When speaking to secular audiences, we might emphasize different aspects of faith than when speaking within religious communities.

##### Leadership and Influence
The bechor concept applies to Christian leadership - those called to influence others carry the responsibility to model the Father's character authentically, not just communicate religious information.

##### Understanding Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility
The Pharaoh narrative provides a framework for understanding how God can be sovereign while humans remain truly responsible. God provides opportunities for genuine understanding and choice, even strengthening people's resolve when they choose poorly.

##### Prayer and Relationship with God
The shift from El Shaddai to Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh represents moving from seeing God primarily as the powerful restrainer to experiencing Him as the eternal, personal presence who transcends time but engages intimately with creation.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Jewish-Christian Dialogue
- Compare rabbinic interpretations of Exodus with Christian theological perspectives
- Explore how Jewish understanding of Torah enhances Christian reading of Scripture
- Study the connection between Passover and communion/Eucharist

##### Comparative Religion Studies
- Analyze how ancient Near Eastern polytheistic systems compare to modern secular worldviews
- Examine how monotheistic principles challenge contemporary pluralistic assumptions
- Study the historical development from polytheism to monotheism in ancient cultures

##### Biblical Theology
- Trace the firstborn theme throughout Scripture (Abel, Isaac, Jacob, David, Jesus)
- Explore birth and rebirth imagery across biblical narratives
- Study the progression of divine revelation through various names of God

##### Philosophy of Religion
- Investigate the relationship between divine sovereignty and human freedom
- Examine the nature of authentic choice versus mere compliance
- Study how worldview shapes interpretation of evidence and experience

##### Practical Theology
- Develop principles for cross-cultural evangelism based on Moses' approach to Pharaoh
- Create frameworks for discipleship that emphasize being the message
- Design worship practices that reflect both God's transcendence and immanence

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis Question:** How do the two Hebrew words for hardening Pharaoh's heart (kavod and hazak) help us understand the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility? What does this suggest about the nature of authentic choice?

2. **Application Question:** Moses presented two different arguments to Pharaoh based on different worldviews (relational vs. consequence-based). How might this approach inform how Christians communicate with people from different cultural or philosophical backgrounds today?

3. **Synthesis Question:** How does understanding Israel's calling as God's bechor (firstborn by choice rather than birth) reshape our understanding of what it means to be "chosen people" in both Jewish and Christian contexts?

4. **Evaluation Question:** Rabbi Fohrman argues that God's fundamental character is revealed in the name El Shaddai ("The One Who Said Enough") rather than unlimited power. How does this perspective challenge or confirm common assumptions about God's nature, and what implications does this have for how we understand divine justice?

5. **Creative Question:** The Passover narrative uses extensive birth imagery to describe Israel's exodus from Egypt. How might this metaphor of spiritual birth help us understand other biblical concepts like regeneration, baptism, or conversion, and what practical implications might this have for how we approach spiritual formation?

#### Personal Summary

Episode 19 of BEMA presents the Exodus not merely as a historical liberation story, but as a profound theological narrative about God's pursuit of human hearts and the establishment of a new kind of relationship between the divine and humanity. Through Rabbi Fohrman's careful analysis, we see that every element of the story - from the seemingly inefficient ten plagues to Moses' apparently deceptive three-day request - serves a deeper purpose in God's plan to transform worldviews and invite people into authentic relationship.

The episode's central insight revolves around God's character as revealed through His names. Moving from El Shaddai (the God of restraint and wisdom) to Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh (the eternal, timeless presence), we see God revealing Himself as fundamentally relational rather than merely powerful. This challenges both ancient polytheistic thinking and modern secular assumptions about divine nature.

Perhaps most significantly, the discussion reframes Israel's chosenness not as ethnic privilege but as missional calling. Like a firstborn son who must lead siblings in honoring their father, Israel (and by extension, the church) is called to be the message of God's character to the world. This transforms our understanding of election from exclusive benefit to inclusive responsibility.

The episode concludes with the powerful image of Passover as spiritual birth, connecting the Exodus experience to Jesus' teaching about being born again. This metaphor enriches our understanding of salvation as not merely legal transaction but transformative rebirth into a new identity and mission as God's representatives in the world.

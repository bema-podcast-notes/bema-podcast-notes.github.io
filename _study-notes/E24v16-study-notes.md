### BEMA Episode 24: Creating a Space - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary
BEMA Episode 24: "Creating a Space" explores the concept of spiritual disciplines as means of creating intentional space for God to work in our lives. Drawing from the story of the tabernacle as a "mobile Genesis 1," Marty Solomon teaches how ancient practices can transform modern spiritual life by helping believers create sacred spaces that God can fill with His presence.

#### Key Takeaways
- If we create the space for God, He will fill it - though not necessarily in the ways or timing we expect
- The tabernacle represents a reversal of Genesis 1: instead of God creating space for humans to fill, humans create space for God to fill
- Spiritual disciplines are practical tools for creating space, not ends in themselves
- Modern culture's busyness and anxiety often prevent us from experiencing God's presence
- Effective spiritual practice requires intentionality, patience, and willingness to slow down
- Multiple disciplines can be combined and customized to fit individual needs and circumstances
- The goal is not to master all practices but to consistently engage a few that create space for divine encounter

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tabernacle as Mobile Genesis 1
The tabernacle story represents a theological reversal of the creation narrative. In Genesis 1, God creates space and invites humanity to fill it ("be fruitful and multiply"). When humanity fails, God initiates a new pattern: humans create the space (the tabernacle), and God fills it with His presence. This establishes the principle that intentional space-making invites divine encounter.

##### The Two Kingdoms Narrative
Life exists in tension between two competing narratives:
- **Empire**: Characterized by fear, coercion, imperial power, wealth, security, and fame - operating with closed fists
- **Shalom**: Characterized by invitation, trust, and open hands - representing God's counter-narrative to worldly systems

##### Creating Space for God
The central principle that "if you create the space, God will fill it" operates on several levels:
- God may not fill the space in expected ways or timing
- God will not necessarily do what we want with the space
- The practice requires letting go of control over outcomes
- Space-creation counteracts cultural busyness and spiritual anxiety

##### Spiritual Disciplines as Space-Making Tools
Spiritual disciplines function not as legalistic requirements but as practical methods for creating sacred space. They work by:
- Slowing down mental and emotional activity
- Creating margin for divine encounter
- Training attention toward God's presence
- Developing spiritual awareness and sensitivity

#### Examples & Applications

##### Prayer Disciplines
- **Prayer Journaling**: Writing prayers and reflections to track God's work over time
- **Fixed-Hour Prayer**: Setting regular alarms (9am, noon, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm) for brief prayer moments
- **Contemplative Prayer**: Repetitive prayers like "Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner" that center the heart
- **Praying the Text**: Using Scripture, especially Psalms, as prayer content rather than creating original prayers

##### Presence Disciplines
- **Solitude, Sabbath, and Silence**: Extended times (4-8 hours) of quiet reflection, often in nature
- **Practicing the Presence of God**: Cultivating awareness of God's companionship in mundane activities like laundry or commuting
- **Simplicity**: Intentionally resisting complexity, acquisition, consumption, and hurry in areas like clothing, eating, transportation, and technology

##### Lifestyle Disciplines
- **Generosity and Secrecy**: Practicing giving without recognition, such as doubling tips or always saying "yes" to requests for help
- **Submission**: Choosing to follow leadership you disagree with (when not morally problematic) as spiritual training
- **Gratitude**: Attempting to offer 70 blessings daily, following Jewish tradition
- **Meditation and Memorization**: Learning Scripture by heart in weekly portions rather than attempting large blocks

##### Calendar and Seasonal Disciplines
- **Fasting**: Not primarily for receiving answers but for connecting with human brokenness and creating space for God's strength
- **Feasting and Celebration**: Knowing when to indulge and celebrate God's goodness
- **Liturgical Calendar**: Following patterns like Advent (descent into darkness) and Lent (preparation) leading to Easter celebration

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Historical and Theological Contexts

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis**: How does the concept of the tabernacle as "mobile Genesis 1" change your understanding of the relationship between human initiative and divine response in spiritual practice?

2. **Application**: Marty mentions that it took him 4-5 hours of solitude before his mind truly slowed down. What does this suggest about the depth of commitment required for effective spiritual practice in our current cultural context?

3. **Evaluation**: Compare and contrast the "empire" and "shalom" narratives described in the episode. How do spiritual disciplines specifically counteract the empire narrative in practical ways?

4. **Synthesis**: How might you combine 2-3 of the spiritual disciplines mentioned to create a personalized approach to "creating space" that fits your current life circumstances?

5. **Critical Thinking**: Marty states his belief that "if you create the space, God will fill it" while acknowledging this isn't directly stated in Scripture. How do you evaluate the validity of principles derived from biblical patterns rather than explicit commands?

#### Personal Summary

Episode 24 presents spiritual disciplines not as religious obligations but as practical tools for creating space where God can work. The core insight that humans must create space for God to fill represents a profound shift from expecting God to break through our busyness to taking responsibility for cultivating receptivity.

The episode's strength lies in its practical approach, offering concrete practices while emphasizing that the goal is not mastery of all disciplines but consistent engagement with a few that create genuine space for divine encounter. Marty's personal stories, particularly his eight-hour lake experience and his mentor Bill's influence, demonstrate the transformative power of sustained commitment to space-making practices.

The teaching challenges contemporary Christian culture's tendency to limit spiritual practice to Bible study and prayer, offering a rich menu of historically-grounded disciplines. The emphasis on patience, process, and letting go of control over outcomes provides a healthy corrective to results-oriented approaches to spirituality.

Most significantly, the episode positions spiritual disciplines within the larger narrative tension between empire and shalom, making clear that these practices are not merely personal enrichment tools but ways of participating in God's counter-narrative to worldly systems of fear and coercion.

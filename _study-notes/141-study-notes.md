# BEMA Episode 141 Study Notes: Mathetes or Talmidim

## Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 141 - Mathetes or Talmidim  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Topic:** An examination of Paul's evolving ministry methodology through Acts 16-20, contrasting Greek concepts of discipleship (mathetes) with Hebrew rabbinic discipleship (talmidim), and analyzing how Paul's approach transforms from church planting to disciple-making over his three missionary journeys.

## Key Takeaways

- The Gospel message is fundamentally about inclusion: "whoever is being pushed out is welcome in"
- Paul's circumcision of Timothy demonstrates Gospel inclusivity - not cultural accommodation but radical welcome
- Paul's ministry evolved from spreading the Gospel widely to creating deep discipleship relationships
- Greek "mathetes" (student/disciple) lacks the depth of Hebrew "talmid" (committed life-long follower)
- Paul's transformation mirrors Jesus' ministry pattern: from zero disciples to about twelve disciples
- Truth can be found everywhere and should be utilized wherever discovered
- Disciple-making appears more central to God's mission than church planting alone
- Paul's apologetic approach adapts to his audience rather than confronting their worldview directly

## Main Concepts & Theories

### Gospel of Inclusion

The central message of the Gospel is radical inclusion, demonstrated through Paul's seemingly contradictory actions regarding circumcision. When Gentiles were excluded for being uncircumcised, Paul argued they didn't need circumcision. When Timothy (a mamzer - illegitimate child) was excluded from circumcision due to his mixed heritage, Paul circumcised him. This reveals that the Gospel reverses whatever forces people to be outsiders.

### Mathetes vs. Talmidim Framework

- **Mathetes (Greek):** A general term covering everything from casual student to committed disciple
- **Limud (Hebrew):** Student who attends classes and learns but doesn't commit to lifestyle imitation  
- **Talmid (Hebrew):** Disciple who commits years to following a rabbi, imitating every aspect of their life
- **Problem:** The Greek New Testament uses only "mathetes" for both concepts, obscuring the distinction

### Paul's Ministry Evolution

**First Journey:** Zero disciples, zero house churches - focused on spreading Gospel message widely  
**Second Journey:** Three disciples (Timothy, Priscilla, Aquila), one house church - beginning community formation  
**Third Journey:** About twelve disciples, multiple house churches - mature discipleship model emerging

### Contextual Apologetics

Paul's approach in Athens demonstrates sophisticated cultural engagement:

- Begins with affirmation rather than confrontation
- Studies and quotes their poets and philosophers
- Uses their own religious symbols (altar to unknown god) as conversation bridges
- Finds truth within their culture to point toward greater truth

## Examples & Applications

### Historical Examples

- **Timothy's Circumcision:** Demonstrates how Gospel inclusion works in practice - Paul fights for inclusion regardless of traditional barriers
- **Athens Speech:** Shows effective cross-cultural communication by meeting people where they are intellectually and spiritually
- **Berean Jews:** Model of noble character through eager reception and careful Scripture examination
- **Corinthian Ministry:** Paul's longest stay (18 months) shows deepening commitment to community formation

### Modern Applications

- **Truth Recognition:** Christians should recognize truth wherever it appears - in secular philosophy, non-Christian religions, popular culture - as all truth belongs to God
- **Ministry Focus:** Balance between broad evangelism and deep discipleship formation, with growing emphasis on the latter as maturity develops
- **Cultural Engagement:** Study and understand the worldview of those we hope to reach rather than immediately confronting their beliefs
- **Inclusion Practice:** Actively work to welcome those whom religious or social systems exclude

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration

### Historical Context

- First-century Jewish attitudes toward mamzerim and circumcision laws
- The role of God-fearers (theosebai) in early Christian communities  
- Comparison between Essene baptism (John's baptism) and Christian baptism
- The significance of prominent women in early Christian communities

### Theological Implications

- The relationship between Paul's conversion/calling experience and his ministry evolution
- The role of the Holy Spirit in directing and redirecting missionary activities
- The connection between disciple-making and church planting in modern missions
- The significance of Luke's deliberate paralleling of Paul's ministry with Jesus' ministry

### Practical Ministry Questions

- How to implement talmidim-style discipleship in contemporary contexts
- Balancing truth recognition with doctrinal discernment
- Methods for deep cultural engagement without compromising core message
- Developing long-term discipleship relationships versus short-term evangelistic impact

## Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** How does Paul's circumcision of Timothy demonstrate the Gospel of inclusion, and why is the common explanation that Paul was avoiding offense to Jews actually incorrect?

2. **Comparison:** Compare and contrast Paul's ministry approach in his first, second, and third missionary journeys. What pattern emerges regarding disciples and house churches?

3. **Cultural Engagement:** Examine Paul's speech in Athens (Acts 17). What specific strategies does he use to communicate with Greek philosophers, and how might these principles apply to modern cross-cultural ministry?

4. **Linguistic Theology:** Explain the difference between mathetes, limud, and talmid. Why is this distinction important for understanding New Testament discipleship?

5. **Synthesis:** How does Luke's deliberate paralleling of Paul's ministry with Jesus' ministry (especially the "about twelve disciples" detail) contribute to the theological message of Acts?

## Brief Personalized Summary

This episode reveals the profound evolution in Paul's ministry from a Gospel broadcaster to a disciple-maker, mirroring Jesus' own approach. The most striking insight is how Paul's actions regarding circumcision—seemingly contradictory but actually consistently inclusive—demonstrate that the Gospel's core message is welcoming whoever is being pushed out.

The distinction between Greek mathetes and Hebrew talmidim challenges our contemporary understanding of discipleship, suggesting we may have settled for creating students when God calls us to make disciples who commit their lives to following Christ. Paul's sophisticated cultural engagement in Athens provides a model for meaningful dialogue across worldview differences, while his ministry evolution from zero to about twelve disciples suggests that God values deep, transformational relationships over broad numerical impact.

This episode fundamentally questions whether our modern focus on church planting and evangelistic reach might be missing the deeper call to rabbinic-style discipleship that characterized both Jesus' and Paul's mature ministry. The challenge is clear: are we making mathetes or talmidim?

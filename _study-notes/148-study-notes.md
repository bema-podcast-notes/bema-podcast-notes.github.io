# BEMA Episode 148: Galatians â€” Set Free to Be Free

## Title & Source Summary

This episode concludes the BEMA podcast's study of Paul's letter to the Galatians, focusing on the implications of the Gospel for both Jews and Gentiles. Hosts Marty Solomon and Brent Billings examine Paul's arguments about freedom from the law, the distinct callings of Jewish and Gentile believers, and how both groups are called to demonstrate God's love through their different approaches to faith. The discussion uses the metaphor of the "Pint o' Bacon" to illustrate the practical differences between Jewish Torah observance and Gentile freedom from the law.

## Key Takeaways

- Paul never questioned whether Jews should continue following Torah; the debate was specifically about whether Gentiles needed to convert to Judaism
- Both Jews and Gentiles have been "set free" - Jews from believing Torah observance justifies them, Gentiles from the burden of converting to Judaism
- Gentile freedom from the law is essential for displaying the Gospel message that "everyone is invited" into God's family
- Freedom is not license for self-indulgence but a calling to serve others in love
- The test for walking in the Spirit versus the flesh is the fruit produced in one's life
- Neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters; what counts is being made into a new creation
- An inclusive Gospel does not mean abandoning accountability or absolute truth

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Two-Audience Structure of Galatians 5:1-2

Paul uses careful pronouns to distinguish his audience. "It is for freedom that Christ has set **us** free" (both Jews and Gentiles), but "Mark my words, I, Paul, tell **you**" (specifically addressing the Gentiles considering circumcision).

### Distinct Callings Within Unity

- **Jewish calling**: Follow Torah to show the world what it looks like to walk according to God's Spirit
- **Gentile calling**: Live in freedom from Torah to demonstrate that everyone is invited into God's family
Both callings serve the same purpose: displaying God's character to the world through different means.

### Flesh (Sarx) vs. Spirit

Paul contrasts living according to "sarx" (animal appetites/fleshly desires) with living according to the Spirit. This is not about sinful nature versus good nature, but about choosing between self-focused living and Spirit-led living that serves others.

### The Fruit Test

Rather than providing a checklist of rules, Paul offers a diagnostic tool: examine the fruit of your life. Acts of the flesh include sexual immorality, hatred, jealousy, selfish ambition, while fruits of the Spirit include love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

### Empire vs. Shalom Narratives

The episode connects to the broader BEMA framework of two competing worldviews:

- **Empire**: Self-preservation, scarcity mindset, getting more for myself
- **Shalom**: Self-sacrifice, abundance mindset, blessing others

## Examples & Applications

### The Pint o' Bacon Scenario

Marty illustrates the practical application by explaining that as a Torah-observant Jew, he wouldn't eat bacon, but might consider it if served unknowingly by a well-meaning Gentile host - prioritizing love and hospitality over dietary law.

### Walking by the Spirit in Daily Life

Instead of following 613 specific commandments, Gentile believers evaluate their choices by asking: "Does this produce love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control?" If the answer is no, they're likely walking according to the flesh rather than the Spirit.

### Accountability Within Freedom

Paul addresses potential concerns about antinomianism by emphasizing gentle restoration of those caught in sin, carrying each other's burdens while taking responsibility for one's own spiritual growth.

### Modern Applications

The episode suggests examining whether contemporary Christianity has created its own "circumcision requirements" - cultural or doctrinal markers that determine who can "sit at the table" rather than focusing on whether people are being made into new creations.

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- The historical and archaeological evidence for Jewish-Gentile unity in early Christian communities
- Deeper study of Paul's use of chiastic structure in Galatians
- The relationship between this Galatians teaching and Paul's fuller development in Romans
- How the Shammai vs. Hillel debate influences New Testament interpretation
- The practical implications of "neither circumcision nor uncircumcision" in contemporary church life
- Augustine's influence on Christian theology regarding flesh/spirit dualism
- The role of the Torah as "pedagogue" in preparing for the Gospel

## Comprehension Questions

1. According to the episode, what is the fundamental difference between what Paul is asking of Jewish believers versus Gentile believers, and why is this distinction crucial for the Gospel message?

2. How does Paul's concept of "flesh" (sarx) differ from the common Christian understanding of "sinful nature," and what implications does this have for understanding the Christian life?

3. What does the "fruit test" reveal about Paul's approach to Christian ethics, and how does this differ from a rule-based system of righteousness?

4. In what ways does the episode suggest that both Jews and Gentiles are "set free," and what are they each set free from?

5. How do the "Empire vs. Shalom" narratives apply to Paul's instructions about using freedom, and what does this reveal about the purpose of Christian liberty?

## Brief Personalized Summary

This episode powerfully concludes the Galatians study by clarifying that Paul's letter addresses two distinct audiences with different callings but the same purpose: demonstrating God's inclusive love. The key insight is that Jewish Torah observance and Gentile freedom from Torah both serve to display the Gospel, but in different ways. Rather than providing rigid rules, Paul offers a fruit-based evaluation system that focuses on whether our lives produce Spirit-led characteristics like love, joy, and peace, or flesh-driven behaviors like hatred, jealousy, and selfish ambition. The episode challenges listeners to examine whether they've created their own "circumcision requirements" in modern Christianity and reminds us that what ultimately matters is not external markers but whether we're being transformed into new creations who sacrificially serve others rather than ourselves.

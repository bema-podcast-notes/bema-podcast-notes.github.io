# BEMA Episode 53: Nahum - Diyn

## Title & Source Summary

This episode explores the Book of Nahum, the prophetic counterbalance to Jonah in the Assyrian prophetic period. While Jonah emphasized God's patience and the potential for repentance, Nahum addresses the other side of divine justice - God's eventual response to unrepentant evil and injustice. The book was written to Israel after the Assyrian conquest, offering hope to the oppressed that God sees their suffering and will act. The episode examines the tension between God's patience (hesed) and God's judgment (diyn), revealing that these are not equal opposing forces but exist in a 1000-to-3 ratio favoring mercy.

## Key Takeaways

- **Nahum is the counterbalance to Jonah**: While Jonah emphasizes God's patience and desire for repentance, Nahum demonstrates that God does not ignore ongoing injustice indefinitely
- **Introduction of "diyn"**: A Hebrew concept meaning judgment with finality, as opposed to "mishpat" (distributive/restorative justice) - diyn represents the necessary judgment that enables restoration to occur
- **The 1000-to-3 ratio**: God's patience and mercy far outweigh His judgment, but justice is still part of His character and necessary for cosmic restoration
- **Context is crucial**: Nahum was written to oppressed Israel as a message of hope, not primarily as a threat to readers today
- **God hears the cry of the oppressed**: The prophecy against Nineveh demonstrates that God is deeply concerned with how empires treat conquered peoples
- **Both truths must be held together**: Like holding Jonah in one hand and Nahum in the other, we must embrace both God's patience and His eventual action against unrepentant evil

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Assyrian Prophetic Period

The Assyrian period includes prophets who addressed Israel's relationship with the Assyrian empire that conquered the Northern Kingdom. Two prophets emerge in this context:

1. **Jonah** - Emphasized God's concern for Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, and their potential for repentance
2. **Nahum** - Announced God's judgment on Nineveh for their persistent cruelty and injustice

These represent "two sides of the coin" - different aspects of how God deals with evil in the world.

### Pre-Assyrian Prophets: A Pattern of Warning

Before the Assyrian conquest, four prophets warned God's people:
- **To Israel**: Amos and Hosea warned about injustice and lack of care for the marginalized
- **To Judah**: Micah and First Isaiah issued similar warnings

The pattern: Judah listened and repented (imperfectly), and was rescued. Israel did not listen and was conquered by Assyria.

### Diyn vs. Mishpat: Two Expressions of Justice

**Mishpat** (Distributive/Restorative Justice):
- The predominant form of justice throughout the Hebrew Bible
- Focuses on putting things back in their proper place
- About restoration rather than retribution
- Eastern patriarchal justice concept
- Represents God's primary approach to dealing with wrongdoing

**Diyn** (Judgment with Finality):
- Used far less frequently than mishpat (approximately 1000-to-3 ratio)
- Carries an "air of finality"
- Not purely retributive, but represents a necessary decision point
- Sometimes required in order to achieve mishpat
- Represents the moment when "the discussion is over, and we need to get on with restoring the world"

### The Nature of God: Patience and Justice

**God's Patience (from Jonah)**:
- God is "slow to anger"
- God sees potential in all people
- God desires repentance rather than judgment
- God grieves, mourns, and pleads with humanity
- God's default position is patience and hope

**God's Justice (from Nahum)**:
- God does not ignore injustice forever
- God hears the cry of the oppressed
- God acts when repentance is persistently refused
- God's action brings hope to victims of oppression
- "The Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished"

### The Two Agendas in Prophetic Literature

Throughout the prophets, two recurring concerns emerge (Source A and Source B agendas):

1. **Justice and Empire** (how nations treat people, especially the marginalized)
2. **Idolatry and Immorality** (worship of false gods and moral corruption)

**In Nahum's case**:
- Chapter 1: Brief mention of idols and images (Source B)
- Chapter 2: Clear emphasis on injustice - the "lion's den" metaphor describing Assyria's predatory accumulation of plunder
- Chapter 3: Mentions prostitution and witchcraft (Source B), but closes with emphasis on "endless cruelty" (Source A)
- The balance appears relatively even, with slight emphasis on justice concerns

### Prophetic Hyperbole

Nahum employs intense, vivid, and sometimes shocking language to make its point:
- "I will lift your skirts over your face"
- "I will pelt you with filth"
- Descriptions of violence, destruction, and humiliation

This is prophetic exaggeration used to communicate with "veracity and clarity" - stating points without "wishy-washiness." The language is intentionally electric and loaded in Hebrew, designed to convey the seriousness of the message.

### The Problem Nahum Addresses

**The Tension**: Jonah explains God's patience and apparent inaction, but doesn't fully address the problem of evil that continues to exist. While God's patience gives hope to potential repenters, it creates anguish for victims of ongoing injustice.

**The Soul's Cry**: When witnessing injustice - rape, murder, brutality, oppression - the human soul cries out for deliverance. How long must victims wait?

**Nahum's Answer**: God is patient, forgiving, mournful, pleading, and grieving - but eventually God acts. This is not abandonment of patience, but the necessary completion of the justice process when repentance is refused.

### Historical Context: Assyrian Brutality

The Assyrian empire was known for extreme cruelty in warfare and occupation:
- Rape of women
- Impaling children on poles
- Burning elderly people in their homes
- Systematic terror as a tool of empire
- Endless cruelty that touched every conquered nation

This context is essential for understanding Nahum. The book wasn't written to terrify readers with divine wrath, but to comfort victims with the promise that God sees their suffering and will act.

### The Message of Hope

For oppressed Israel hearing Nahum's prophecy:
- **Validation**: God sees what has been done to you
- **Justice promised**: God will not ignore this forever
- **Divine concern**: God cares about how empires treat conquered peoples
- **Future deliverance**: The oppressor will fall
- **Restoration coming**: When judgment comes, it enables restoration (mishpat) to occur

The repeated phrase "I am against you" from God to Nineveh would have been profoundly comforting to those suffering under Assyrian rule.

### Theological Tension We Must Hold

The episode emphasizes that we must hold both truths simultaneously:

**Jonah in one hand**:
- God's incredible patience
- Hope for all people's potential
- Divine reluctance to judge
- Compassion even for enemies

**Nahum in the other hand**:
- God hears the cry of the oppressed
- God will eventually act against unrepentant evil
- Justice is part of God's character
- Deliverance will come for victims

**Not a Balance**: These aren't equal opposing forces. It's 1000-to-3 in favor of patience and mercy. But the 3 matters - it's real and necessary.

### Trust in God's Wisdom

The episode concludes with an important theological point:
- Humans would not do well in deciding when to show patience and when to bring judgment
- We must trust God's perspective, wisdom, and timing
- "Vengeance is mine, declares the Lord" (Deuteronomy) - we turn this over to God
- We trust "the story" - God's overall eternal wisdom and plan

Both Jonah and Nahum are true. Both go in our pockets. We trust God to navigate the tension between them.

## Examples & Applications

### Real-World Example: The Assyrian Conquest

The historical reality that prompted Nahum's prophecy provides the clearest example of the concepts explored:

**The Situation**: Israel had been conquered by Assyria, one of the most brutal empires in ancient history. Israelites were experiencing:
- Systematic violence and terror
- Loss of homeland and autonomy
- Ongoing oppression under foreign rule
- Watching family members suffer and die
- Questioning whether God cared about their suffering

**The Question**: After hearing Jonah's message about God's patience with Nineveh and concern for the Assyrians, Israelites wondered: "Does God care about what's happening to us? Will He do anything about this injustice?"

**Nahum's Answer**: Yes, God does care. Yes, God will act. The same Nineveh that repented in Jonah's time has returned to extreme brutality, and God will bring judgment.

### Application: Understanding Modern Prophetic Messages

When reading prophetic literature or applying it today:

**Wrong Approach**: "What does this mean for ME?" - reading Nahum as a personal threat or warning about God's anger at my sins creates fear and misses the point.

**Right Approach**: Understanding context - Nahum was written to comfort victims of oppression, not to terrorize readers. The message is: "God sees injustice and will eventually act."

**Modern Parallel**: When victims of systematic injustice today read Nahum, they should hear: "Your suffering is not invisible to God. Divine justice will come, even if it seems delayed."

### Application: The Cry for Justice

The episode addresses a common human experience:

**The Scenario**: We witness or experience injustice - abuse, oppression, violence, systemic evil - and wonder why God doesn't act immediately.

**The Tension**:
- We want God to be patient with our own failures (the Jonah perspective)
- We want God to act swiftly against others' evil (the Nahum perspective)
- We struggle to understand why God seems slow to respond to obvious injustice

**The Biblical Response**:
- God IS slow to anger (this is a feature, not a bug)
- God's patience allows for repentance and restoration
- God WILL eventually act when repentance is refused
- The timing is based on divine wisdom we don't possess
- We must trust the process even when it's painful

### Application: The Ratio in Practice

The 1000-to-3 ratio provides practical guidance:

**In Individual Relationships**: When someone wrongs us, our default should be patience, forgiveness, and hope for restoration (the 1000). But persistent, unrepentant abuse may require boundaries and consequences (the 3).

**In Systemic Justice Work**: Advocates for justice should:
- Maintain hope that systems and people can change
- Work tirelessly for restoration and reconciliation
- Recognize that some situations require definitive action
- Trust that ultimate justice belongs to God

**In Self-Assessment**: When evaluating our own failures:
- Remember God's primary characteristic is patience (the 1000)
- Don't presume on grace or ignore the need for repentance
- Understand that unrepented patterns eventually have consequences (the 3)

### Example: The Lion's Den Metaphor

Nahum 2 uses the image of a lion killing prey and stockpiling it in its den:

**The Metaphor**: Assyria is like a lion that kills not just for sustenance but for accumulation, stockpiling prey in its den while continuing to hunt for more.

**The Reality**: Empire takes from conquered peoples not out of necessity but out of greed, accumulating wealth and power while leaving destruction in its wake.

**God's Response**: "I am against you because of how you've treated those that you've conquered."

**Modern Application**: This metaphor applies to any system (national, economic, social) that exploits and accumulates at the expense of vulnerable populations. Nahum affirms that God opposes such systems and will act to bring justice.

### Application: Holding Both Truths

Practical ways to hold Jonah and Nahum together:

**In Prayer**:
- Pray for the transformation of those who do evil (Jonah)
- Pray for justice and deliverance for victims (Nahum)
- Trust God to navigate the tension between these prayers

**In Action**:
- Work for restorative justice that seeks redemption (Jonah)
- Support protection and accountability for perpetrators (Nahum)
- Recognize both are necessary for true justice

**In Faith**:
- Believe in the possibility of change (Jonah)
- Believe God will ultimately right wrongs (Nahum)
- Accept we don't have to solve the tension - God does

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration

**Questions to explore**:
- What specific practices made Assyria notorious for brutality?
- How did Assyrian military and administrative policies differ from other ancient empires?
- What archaeological evidence exists for Assyrian treatment of conquered peoples?
- How long did Assyria persist in these practices after Jonah's ministry?

**Why it matters**: Understanding the historical reality deepens appreciation for why Nahum was necessary and comforting to Israel.

### 2. The Concept of Diyn in Hebrew Scripture

**Areas to investigate**:
- Where else does diyn appear in the Hebrew Bible?
- How is it used differently from mishpat in various contexts?
- What is the etymological relationship between diyn and related words (like "judge")?
- How do Jewish commentators throughout history interpret diyn?

**Why it matters**: A fuller understanding of diyn could illuminate other passages where God's judgment is discussed.

### 3. The Relationship Between Justice and Restoration

**Theological questions**:
- How does judgment (diyn) actually enable restoration (mishpat)?
- Can there be restoration without judgment in cases of persistent injustice?
- What does this mean for concepts like restorative justice in modern contexts?
- How do we balance accountability with the hope for transformation?

**Why it matters**: This has direct implications for criminal justice, interpersonal conflict resolution, and how communities address harm.

### 4. Prophetic Hyperbole and Ancient Near Eastern Literature

**Research directions**:
- How common was hyperbolic language in ancient Near Eastern prophetic literature?
- What cultural understanding did the original audience have about such language?
- How do we distinguish between literal prophecy and hyperbolic expression?
- What are the implications for reading other prophetic books?

**Why it matters**: Understanding ancient literary conventions helps us read prophetic literature more accurately and apply it more appropriately.

### 5. The Problem of Divine Violence in Scripture

**Important questions**:
- How do we reconcile images of violent divine judgment with Jesus' teachings about enemy love?
- What is the relationship between Old Testament judgment passages and New Testament revelation?
- How do different theological traditions handle these texts?
- What role does divine judgment play in a comprehensive biblical theology?

**Why it matters**: This is a significant stumbling block for many modern readers and requires careful theological work.

### 6. Victim Theology and Prophetic Literature

**Areas to explore**:
- How should victims of injustice read and apply Nahum today?
- What other biblical texts specifically address victims of oppression?
- How can the church better minister to victims using these texts?
- What is the relationship between divine justice and human justice work?

**Why it matters**: Many people reading Scripture today are victims of various forms of injustice and need to hear the message of hope Nahum offered.

### 7. The Timing of Divine Justice

**Theological investigation**:
- What biblical principles exist regarding God's timing in acting against evil?
- How do concepts like "the sin of the Amorites hasn't reached its full potential" (mentioned in the episode) work?
- What role does human response and repentance play in divine timing?
- How does eschatology (end times theology) relate to Nahum's message?

**Why it matters**: Understanding divine timing helps us maintain faith during periods when justice seems delayed.

### 8. Comparative Prophetic Study

**Research project**:
- Create a comprehensive comparison of all the prophets discussed: Amos (plumb line), Hosea (prostitute), Micah (judge), First Isaiah (vineyard), Jonah (potential), Nahum (diyn)
- Map the progression of themes and concerns
- Analyze how they work together as a collection
- Study the canonical arrangement and its significance

**Why it matters**: The prophets form a cohesive message when read together, and understanding their interrelationship enhances interpretation of each individual book.

### 9. The Two Agendas in All Prophetic Literature

**Comprehensive study**:
- Conduct a systematic analysis of Source A (justice/empire) and Source B (idolatry/immorality) concerns across all prophetic books
- Examine whether certain historical periods emphasize one over the other

- What is the church's role in being a voice of Nahum-like hope to the oppressed?

**Why it matters**: Moving from ancient text to modern application requires careful theological and practical work.

## Comprehension Questions

### Question 1: The Two Sides of the Justice Coin

Explain how Jonah and Nahum represent "two sides of the coin" in God's dealing with evil. Why is it important to hold both prophetic messages together rather than choosing one or the other? What happens if we only emphasize Jonah's message? What happens if we only emphasize Nahum's message?

**Key concepts to address**: God's patience vs. God's judgment, the potential for repentance vs. the reality of unrepentant evil, hope for perpetrators vs. hope for victims, the 1000-to-3 ratio

### Question 2: Understanding Diyn and Mishpat

Define the two Hebrew concepts of justice discussed in this episode: mishpat and diyn. How are they different? How are they related? Why does the episode say that diyn is sometimes necessary in order to achieve mishpat? Provide an example (biblical or modern) that illustrates this relationship.

**Key concepts to address**: Distributive/restorative justice vs. judgment with finality, the relative frequency of each concept in Scripture, the progression from patience to action, the purpose of judgment in God's plan

### Question 3: Context and Interpretation

The episode emphasizes that Nahum should be read with its context in mind. Who was the original audience for Nahum's prophecy? What was their situation? How does understanding this context change how we should read the book today? Why is the "What does this mean for ME?" approach problematic when reading Nahum?

**Key concepts to address**: Israel's oppression under Assyria, message of hope vs. message of threat, historical situation, proper application of prophetic literature, the danger of decontextualized reading

### Question 4: The Problem Nahum Addresses

The episode states that "the problem with the book of Jonah is that while the book explains God's apparent inaction and unbelievable patience, it still doesn't deal with the problem of evil that continues to exist." Explain this problem. What question does Jonah answer? What question does Jonah leave unanswered? How does Nahum address the question Jonah doesn't answer?

**Key concepts to address**: The tension between divine patience and ongoing injustice, the cry of victims for deliverance, God's slowness to anger, the necessity of eventual action, completing the justice process

### Question 5: The 1000-to-3 Ratio

Explain what the "1000-to-3 ratio" means in terms of God's character and how He deals with evil. Why is it important that this is NOT a balance or "equal and opposing forces"? How should this ratio inform how we think about God's judgment? How should it inform how we think about our own need for patience with others?

**Key concepts to address**: The predominance of mercy over judgment, God's primary characteristic as patient and loving, the reality that judgment does occur, trusting God's wisdom in deciding timing, application to human relationships and justice work

## Personalized Summary

This episode examines one of the most challenging tensions in biblical theology: how a patient, loving God relates to persistent, unrepentant evil. Through the Book of Nahum, we encounter the less-emphasized but necessary side of divine justice - diyn, or judgment with finality.

The key to understanding Nahum is recognizing it as the counterbalance to Jonah, not a contradiction of it. Jonah reveals a God who is slow to anger, who sees potential in all people, who desires repentance rather than judgment. This is God's primary character - the 1000 in the 1000-to-3 ratio. But Nahum reminds us of the 3: there comes a point when ongoing injustice requires divine intervention. When empires brutalize conquered peoples, when the strong prey upon the weak, when evil persists despite opportunities for repentance, God eventually acts.

Crucially, Nahum was written not as a threat but as hope. Oppressed Israel, suffering under Assyrian brutality, needed to hear that God saw their pain, that their suffering was not invisible, that deliverance would come. The same Nineveh that repented in Jonah's time had returned to violence and cruelty, and God's patience, though vast, was not infinite.

This creates a tension we must live in: believing both in the possibility of transformation (Jonah) and in the certainty of ultimate justice (Nahum). We hold both truths, trusting God to navigate between them with wisdom we don't possess. We pray for the redemption of those who do evil while also praying for the deliverance of their victims. We work for restorative justice while supporting necessary accountability. We remember that we would be terrible at God's job - deciding when patience should give way to action - and we're grateful we don't have to make those calls.

The episode concludes with a profound reminder from Deuteronomy: "Vengeance is mine, declares the Lord." We're invited to turn over the entire Jonah-Nahum debate to God, trusting His eternal wisdom and timing. Both prophets are true. Both belong in our pockets. And both point us toward a God who is primarily characterized by patient love, but who will not ignore injustice forever.

For those suffering under oppression today, Nahum's message remains: God sees you, God cares, and God will act. For those of us wrestling with why justice seems delayed, Nahum reminds us that the discussion will eventually end, and restoration will come. The judgment we see in Nahum is not the dominant note of Scripture - it's the necessary 3 that enables the 1000 to ultimately triumph in a restored creation where justice and peace finally reign.

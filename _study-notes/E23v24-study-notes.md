### BEMA Episode 23: Falling on Joyful Faces - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 23: Falling on Joyful Faces (E23v24)  
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 24-40 (Construction of the Tabernacle)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Topic:** The Tabernacle as a mobile reminder of Genesis Creation and God's presence that brings joy, not fear

This episode explores the detailed instructions for building the Tabernacle, revealing how it serves as a portable recreation of the Garden of Eden and God's original creation design, culminating in the profound truth that God's presence should inspire joyful worship rather than fearful cowering.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Tabernacle construction mirrors the Genesis creation account with seven divine speeches and Sabbath rest
- The golden calf incident sits strategically in the center of a chiasm between two sets of identical Tabernacle instructions
- The Tabernacle serves as a mobile Genesis 1-3, carrying the reminder of God's original creative intent through the wilderness
- The Tent of Meeting uses the Hebrew word "moed" - the same word from the center of the Genesis 1 chiasm
- The Ark of the Covenant contains the Law (Torah), often called the "Tree of Life," guarded by cherubim just like in Eden
- When the Tabernacle and Temple were dedicated, people fell face down with joy, not fear
- Believers today are the new temple, and should inspire joyful encounters with God's presence rather than fear

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Seven Divine Speeches Structure
The Tabernacle instructions contain seven instances where "The Lord said to Moses" appears (Exodus 25:1, 30:11, 30:17, 30:22, 31:1, 31:12), paralleling God's seven creative declarations in Genesis 1. The seventh speech specifically addresses Sabbath observance (Exodus 31:12-18), mirroring how God rested on the seventh day of creation.

##### The Chiastic Structure of Exodus 24-40
The narrative forms a chiasm (inverted parallel structure) with these elements:
- **A:** Glory of the Lord (Exodus 24)
- **B:** Tabernacle and priestly garments instructions (Exodus 25-30)  
- **C:** Bezalel, Aholiab, and materials; Sabbath (Exodus 31)
- **D:** CENTER - Golden calf and broken tablets (Exodus 32-34)
- **C':** Bezalel, Aholiab, and materials; Sabbath (Exodus 35)
- **B':** Tabernacle and priestly garments construction (Exodus 36-39)
- **A':** Glory of the Lord fills the Tabernacle (Exodus 40)

**Center of the chiasm:** Exodus 33:14 - "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."

##### The Tabernacle as Mobile Genesis
The Tabernacle recreates key elements from the Garden of Eden:
- **Tree of Life:** The Torah/Law stored in the Ark, traditionally called the "Tree of Life"
- **Cherubim guardians:** Embroidered on the Holy of Holies curtain, just as they guarded Eden's entrance
- **Divine presence:** God's glory dwelling among His people as in the original garden
- **Rest and meeting:** The "Tent of Meeting" (Hebrew: moed) connects to the appointed times and seasons from Genesis 1

##### Creation Language Parallels
The completion of the Tabernacle uses identical language to Genesis creation:
- **Genesis 2:2:** "God had finished the work... so on the seventh day He rested"
- **Exodus 40:33:** "Moses finished the work"
- **Genesis 2:3:** "God blessed the seventh day"
- **Exodus 39:43:** "Moses... blessed them"

##### The Temple Dedication Pattern
Both Tabernacle and Temple dedications followed the same joyful pattern:
1. **Fire from God's presence** consumes the sacrifices
2. **People fall face down** - but in joy, not terror  
3. **Worship and thanksgiving** declaring "His love endures forever"
4. **Recognition of God's goodness** rather than fearful cowering

This pattern extends to Pentecost, where **tongues of fire** rested on believers as the new living temples.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern House Decorating Analogy
Just as couples spend considerable time and attention choosing paint colors, fixtures, and furniture placement to create their ideal home, God provides extensive detail about the Tabernacle design because He delights in creating a beautiful dwelling place with His people.

##### The "Skeleton Practice" 
Marty's discipline of memorizing biblical subtitles to understand Scripture's structure demonstrates how repetitive engagement with God's word reveals patterns and connections not immediately apparent in casual reading.

##### Contemporary Church Application
When people encounter believers today (as God's new temple), the response should mirror the ancient Temple dedications - people should "fall on joyful faces" because they experience God's love and goodness, not fear or judgment.

##### Ray Vander Laan's Challenge
The conviction that modern Christians should be known for inspiring joy in others through God's presence, rather than instilling fear or judgment, challenges contemporary church culture and individual Christian witness.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Detailed study of Tabernacle furniture and symbolism:** Each piece's connection to Creation themes and spiritual significance
- **The role of Bezalel and Aholiab:** God's gifting of artistic and craftsmanship abilities for sacred work  
- **Levitical priesthood and sacrificial system:** How the Tabernacle ceremonies point to broader theological truths
- **Chiastic structures throughout Scripture:** Identifying similar patterns in other biblical narratives
- **The Hebrew word "moed":** Its full range of meanings across festivals, appointments, and divine encounters
- **Sabbath theology:** The connection between Creation rest, Tabernacle completion, and Christian spiritual disciplines
- **Temple theology in the New Testament:** How Jesus and the Church fulfill Tabernacle/Temple imagery
- **The nature of God's presence:** Comparing manifestations from Eden through the Tabernacle to the indwelling Spirit

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How do the seven "Lord said to Moses" speeches in the Tabernacle instructions parallel the Genesis creation account, and what does this suggest about the nature of God's creative work?**

2. **What is the significance of the golden calf narrative being positioned at the center of the chiastic structure in Exodus 24-40, and how does this relate to the promise in Exodus 33:14?**

3. **Explain how the Tabernacle serves as a "mobile Genesis 1-3" and identify at least three specific connections between the Tabernacle design and the Garden of Eden.**

4. **Why is it significant that people "fell on joyful faces" rather than fearful faces during both the Tabernacle and Temple dedications, and what does this reveal about God's character?**

5. **According to the episode's conclusion, how should modern believers (as the new temple of God) impact others, and how might this challenge contemporary Christian culture?**

#### Personal Summary

This episode transforms the seemingly tedious Tabernacle construction narrative into a profound theological statement about God's desire to dwell among His people. The intricate parallels between the Tabernacle building and Genesis creation reveal that God is not simply giving architectural instructions, but recreating Eden in portable form. 

The central message emerges through the chiastic structure: despite human failure (the golden calf), God's promise remains - "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest." The Tabernacle becomes a mobile reminder that God's presence brings joy, celebration, and rest rather than fear and condemnation.

Most convicting is the challenge that modern Christians, as living temples, should inspire the same joyful response that characterized ancient Temple dedications. People should encounter God's love and goodness through believers in ways that cause them to "fall on joyful faces" in worship rather than recoil in fear or judgment. This reframes Christian witness from fear-based evangelism to joy-filled demonstration of God's enduring love and character.

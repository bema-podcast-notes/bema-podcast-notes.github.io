# BEMA Episode 152: Romans â€” The Struggle

## Title & Source Summary

This BEMA podcast episode explores Paul's metaphorical teachings in Romans 6-8 about covenants, death, and the internal struggle between our spiritual nature and our "sarx" (animal appetites). Marty Solomon and Brent Billings examine Paul's use of slavery and marriage metaphors to explain how believers have died to their old ways of thinking and been freed from condemnation through Christ.

## Key Takeaways

- Paul uses real-life metaphors (slavery, marriage) to explain theological realities about freedom from sin
- The famous verse "wages of sin is death" connects to Paul's broader argument about wages vs. gifts that began in Romans 4 with Abraham
- "Sarx" (flesh) refers to our animal appetites, not inherent sinful nature or total depravity
- The law is holy and good - it reveals sin but doesn't cause it; sin is an intruder within us, not our true identity
- Paul's struggle in Romans 7 describes the conflict between wanting to do good and being influenced by our beast nature
- There is no condemnation for those in Christ - nothing can separate us from God's love
- The struggle is real but doesn't define us; we are children of God made in His image
- Creation itself groans for redemption, emphasizing restoration of this world, not escape from it

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Metaphor of Slavery and Freedom

Paul explains that just as slaves were bound to their masters, believers were once enslaved to sin as a taskmaster. However, through baptism (symbolic death), believers have died to this old master and are now free to serve righteousness. The metaphor was particularly relevant since approximately one in three people in the Roman Empire lived under some form of slavery.

### Marriage Metaphor and Covenant Death

Using marriage law, Paul illustrates that when a husband dies, the wife is legally free to remarry. Similarly, believers have died to their old covenant relationship based on working for justification and are now free to enter a new covenant relationship with Christ based on grace and faith.

### The Concept of Sarx (Animal Appetites)

The Greek word "sarx" is often mistranslated as "sinful nature" but actually refers to our animal appetites or beast-like nature. This connects back to Genesis where humans are called to master their animal impulses and choose when to say "enough." It's not about total depravity but about the ongoing struggle between our image-bearing nature and our baser instincts.

### The Law's Role and Purpose

Paul clarifies that the law is not the problem - it's holy, righteous, and good. The law serves as a pedagogue (teacher) that reveals what sin is and points toward righteousness. Without the law, we wouldn't understand concepts of right and wrong. The issue isn't the law itself but how sin uses the law to produce rebellion within us.

### The Internal Struggle (Romans 7)

Paul describes the real human experience of wanting to do good but finding himself doing what he hates. This isn't evidence of total depravity but proof that our true self (made in God's image) conflicts with the sin that dwells within us as an intruder. The struggle validates our goodness rather than negates it.

### No Condemnation Principle

Because God justifies by faith rather than works, and because Christ intercedes for believers, there is no condemnation. This freedom from condemnation allows believers to live authentically without the crushing weight of guilt and shame that comes from trying to earn righteousness.

## Examples & Applications

### Historical Context Application

First-century Roman believers faced literal persecution, imprisonment, and even execution. Paul's assurance that nothing - including Caesar's condemnation or Roman swords - could separate them from God's love would have been profoundly encouraging during times of physical suffering and social ostracism.

### Modern Psychological Application

Paul's teaching addresses contemporary struggles with guilt, shame, and self-condemnation. The principle that we are loved unconditionally provides the psychological foundation for healthy self-image and authentic living, echoing Freud's observation that "how bold one gets when one is sure of being loved."

### Practical Life Struggles

The sarx concept helps explain everyday moral struggles - the tension between knowing what's right and being tempted by immediate gratification, pride, fear, or selfishness. Understanding this as a battle rather than inevitable defeat empowers believers to engage the struggle with hope.

### Creation Care Implications

Paul's teaching that all creation groans for redemption and that this world (not a future one) will be restored provides theological foundation for environmental stewardship and social justice as expressions of participating in God's redemptive work.

- Investigation of Greek philosophical concepts of human nature (sarx vs. pneuma) in Paul's writings
- Historical research on persecution of Christians in Rome during Paul's era
- Theological exploration of predestination concepts that Paul mentions (to be covered in Episode 153)
- Study of the relationship between justification and sanctification in Pauline theology
- Cross-reference analysis of Paul's use of similar metaphors in other epistles (Galatians, Colossians)
- Investigation of how different Bible translations have handled key Greek terms like sarx
- Exploration of the "already/not yet" tension in Paul's eschatology regarding redemption

## Comprehension Questions

1. How does Paul's use of the slavery metaphor in Romans 6 connect to his earlier discussion of wages versus gifts in Romans 4, and what does this reveal about his understanding of justification?

2. Explain the difference between the traditional translation of "sarx" as "sinful nature" versus understanding it as "animal appetites," and discuss how this interpretation changes our understanding of human nature and moral struggle.

3. In what ways does Paul's marriage metaphor in Romans 7:1-6 illustrate the believer's relationship to the law, and why is it important that Paul clarifies this doesn't mean abandoning Torah observance?

4. How does Paul's description of his internal struggle in Romans 7:14-25 actually support the idea that humans are fundamentally good rather than totally depraved, and what role does sin play as an "intruder"?

5. What is the significance of Paul's statement that "creation itself" groans for redemption, and how does this inform our understanding of God's redemptive purposes for this world rather than escape from it?

## Brief Personalized Summary

Paul's teaching in Romans 6-8 offers a profoundly hopeful perspective on human nature and the Christian struggle. Rather than viewing ourselves as fundamentally flawed or hopelessly sinful, Paul presents a picture of image-bearers wrestling with animal impulses - a struggle that validates rather than negates our divine calling. The shift from working for wages to receiving gifts, from slavery to sonship, and from condemnation to freedom creates space for authentic growth without the crushing burden of perfectionism. Most encouraging is Paul's absolute certainty that nothing can separate us from God's love - not our failures, struggles, circumstances, or even literal persecution. This security provides the foundation for bold, authentic living and participation in God's redemptive work in this world. The struggle is real, but it's not the end of the story.

### BEMA Episode 21 Study Notes: With All Your Soul & "Very"

#### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Episode 21: "With All Your Soul & 'Very'"** explores the second and third tests that the Israelites faced on their journey to Mount Sinai. This episode focuses on the Hebrew concepts of *nephesh* (soul) and *meod* (very/might), examining how God tested His people's commitment through trials involving water at Massah and Meribah, and the battle against the Amalekites. The episode reveals how these tests connect to the foundational prayer known as the Shema.

#### Key Takeaways

- The Israelites underwent three tests on their way to Mount Sinai: heart (*vav*), soul (*nephesh*), and very/might (*meod*)
- The test of the soul involved demanding proof from God rather than trusting His provision
- Testing God differs fundamentally from asking God for help in belief (as Gideon did)
- God's response to testing demonstrates His character of grace - He takes the blow on behalf of His people
- The test of *meod* (very/might) reveals how we use our resources to protect the vulnerable
- All three tests ultimately examine how the community treats those who cannot care for themselves
- The Shema prayer encompasses loving God with heart, soul, and might, plus loving neighbor as yourself

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Nature of Nephesh (Soul)
*Nephesh* represents the entirety of a person's being - not just spirit, but the complete integration of body, spirit, emotions, intellect, and consciousness. It encompasses everything that makes "you" you, including both physical and transcendent aspects of personhood.

##### Testing God vs. Seeking God's Help
The episode distinguishes between two types of interaction with God:
- **Testing God**: Making demands with ultimatums ("God, you don't get me unless you do X")
- **Seeking Help**: Asking for reassurance in genuine struggle with belief (like Gideon's fleece)

The Israelites crossed into dangerous territory by demanding God prove Himself repeatedly rather than trusting His demonstrated faithfulness.

##### The Symbolism of Striking the Rock
When God commanded Moses to strike (*nakah* - to smite/kill) the rock at Horeb with God standing between Moses and the mountain, it created a powerful visual metaphor. The elders witnessed what appeared to be Moses striking God Himself, demonstrating God's willingness to take the blow on behalf of His people - foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.

##### Meod and Community Resource Usage
*Meod* (very/might) refers to one's resources, strength, and capabilities. The test of *meod* during the Amalekite attack revealed whether the Israelites would use their strength to protect the vulnerable (those traditionally attacked by Amalekites - the sick, weak, and slow at the back of the group).

##### Banners and Divine Direction
Moses' staff raised as a banner (*Adonai Nissi* - "The Lord is My Banner") served not as magic but as a directional marker. Ancient banners pointed to what lay behind them - typically temples and gods. Moses' raised staff reminded the fighters that their true strength came from God who stood behind the banner.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Community Structure
The episode contrasts two community models:
- **Empire communities**: Place weak and marginalized on fringes or bottom, building on their backs
- **Shalom communities**: Circle wagons around vulnerable members, placing them in protective center

##### Resource Usage in Crisis
The Gideon parallel illustrates choosing people who think of others even in personal need - soldiers who cupped water in hands to drink quickly and make way for others, showing concern for community welfare over personal comfort.

##### Contemporary Testing of God
Modern believers may unconsciously test God by setting conditions: "I'll follow God if He provides X" or "God gets my commitment only when He meets my demands." This differs from honest prayers for strength in doubt or guidance in difficult circumstances.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- The full traditional Shema prayer and its components from Deuteronomy and Numbers
- The historical and geographical context of the Sinai Peninsula and its rock formations
- The role of the tribe of Dan as rear guard in protecting vulnerable community members
- Connections between these tests and Jesus' teachings about the two greatest commandments
- The relationship between individual faith tests and community formation
- Ancient Near Eastern banner symbolism and its theological significance

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How does the Hebrew understanding of *nephesh* (soul) differ from modern Western concepts of soul, and why is this distinction important for understanding the second test?**

2. **What specific evidence from Psalm 78 reveals the Israelites' attitude during their wilderness testing, and how does this commentary enhance our understanding of the Exodus narrative?**

3. **Explain the symbolic significance of God standing between Moses and the rock during the water miracle, and how this event prefigures themes found throughout Scripture.**

4. **How do the three tests (heart, soul, very) collectively reveal God's priorities for community formation, particularly regarding treatment of vulnerable members?**

5. **In what ways does the concept of *Adonai Nissi* (The Lord is My Banner) function both practically and theologically during the battle against the Amalekites?**

#### Personal Summary

Episode 21 reveals that God's testing of His people centers not on individual spiritual performance but on community character - specifically how they treat those who cannot care for themselves. The progression from heart to soul to might demonstrates increasing levels of commitment, moving from internal trust to total life surrender to active resource deployment for others' benefit. The Israelites' failures in these tests don't result in divine abandonment but in divine grace, as seen when God literally places Himself in harm's way during the rock-striking incident. This pattern establishes that authentic love for God inevitably manifests as sacrificial care for neighbors, making the later formulation of the two greatest commandments a natural outflow of these wilderness lessons. The tests ultimately prepare God's people not just for Mount Sinai's revelation but for their calling as a community that embodies divine *shalom* by protecting rather than exploiting the vulnerable.

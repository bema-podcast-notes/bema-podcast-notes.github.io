# BEMA Episode 45: Wisdom and Meaning - Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 45 - Wisdom and Meaning  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon & Brent Billings (with guest Kevin Luo)  
**Topic:** An exploration of wisdom literature, specifically the books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, examining how these texts function as practical tools for navigating the redemption cycle and finding meaning in life.

This episode continues the study of wisdom literature by examining two key biblical books: Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. The discussion frames these texts not as comprehensive doctrinal statements but as practical tools (alongside the Psalms) that help God's people navigate the ongoing struggle of life within the redemption cycle. The hosts explore how proverbs function as "wise sayings that are generally true," how Proverbs presents wisdom and folly as competing women, and how Ecclesiastes addresses the fundamental human search for meaning and purpose.

## Key Takeaways

- **Wisdom literature provides three essential tools for the journey:** songs (Psalms), wisdom (Proverbs), and meaning/purpose (Ecclesiastes)
- **Proverbs are "wise sayings that are generally true"** - they contain genuine wisdom but are not absolute, universal laws without exception
- **The book of Proverbs presents wisdom as a dance between two allegorical women:** Lady Wisdom (representing Torah/obedience) and the adulteress of foolishness and folly
- **Key themes in Proverbs include:** wealth and riches, family, and especially the power and restraint of speech
- **Ecclesiastes appears depressing on the surface** ("everything is meaningless") but contains profound wisdom about finding true meaning
- **Real meaning and purpose come from legacy and self-sacrifice,** not self-preservation - "a good name is better than fine perfume"
- **The house of mourning teaches more than the house of feasting** - showing up for others in their grief creates lasting impact
- **When in doubt, shut up** - restraint in speech is a mark of wisdom

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Redemption Cycle Context

The episode begins by reviewing the biblical narrative framework established in previous episodes:

- After the Exodus and Torah, God placed His people at the crossroads of the earth (Joshua)
- The period of Judges showed a continuous cycle - not just a "sin cycle" but a "redemption cycle" that emphasizes God's patience, long-suffering, and loving-kindness
- The period of kings (Saul, David, Solomon) led to a divided kingdom that devolved into an anti-story
- Into this mess, wisdom literature provides tools for survival and faithfulness

### Three Tools for the Journey

Wisdom literature offers three essential tools:

1. **Song (Psalms):** A "mobile party" that reminds us of the story we're trusting, even when we don't feel like singing
2. **Wisdom (Proverbs):** Practical guidance for navigating daily life
3. **Meaning (Ecclesiastes):** Understanding our "why" - the purpose that makes everything else make sense

### Understanding Proverbs: "Wise Sayings That Are Generally True"

This phrase captures the essential nature of proverbial wisdom:

- **Not comprehensive or universal:** Proverbs contain genuine wisdom but always have exceptions
- **Not for doctrinal statements:** They shouldn't be used to create rigid theological positions
- **Situationally valuable:** They provide guidance that applies in most circumstances

**Examples of proverbs with exceptions:**

- "The Lord will not let the righteous go hungry" (Proverbs 10:3) - while generally true, there have been righteous people who experienced hunger
- "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but the wise man accepts advice" (Proverbs 12:15) - even wise people sometimes struggle to accept advice
- "An inheritance quickly gained at the beginning will not be blessed at the end" (Proverbs 20:21) - generally wise, but not without exceptions

### The Dance of Two Women in Proverbs

Proverbs 1-9 presents wisdom and temptation as two competing women:

- **Lady Wisdom:** Represents Torah, obedience, and the way of life
  - Ancient rabbis and mystical traditions saw Lady Wisdom as synonymous with Torah
  - Torah/Wisdom was present at creation, eternally existing with God
  - This parallels John 1 - "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"

- **The Adulteress:** Represents foolishness, folly, and the way of death

- **The Proverbs 31 Woman:** The book concludes with this famous passage, which some see as the culmination of Lady Wisdom - the embodiment of wisdom in practical, daily life

### Key Themes in Proverbs

The book contains recurring themes that provide comprehensive guidance:

**1. Wealth and Riches:**
- "Lazy hands make for poverty, but diligent hands bring wealth" (Proverbs 10:4)
- "A kind-hearted woman gains honor, but ruthless men gain only wealth" (Proverbs 11:16)

**2. Family:**
- "A wife of noble character is her husband's crown, but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones" (Proverbs 12:4)
- "Whoever fears the Lord has a secure fortress, and for their children it will be a refuge" (Proverbs 14:26)

**3. Speech (particularly emphasized in the episode):**
- "Sin is not ended by multiplying words, but the prudent hold their tongues" (Proverbs 10:19)
- "The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the speech of the upright rescues them" (Proverbs 12:6)
- "The one who has knowledge uses words with restraint, and whoever has understanding is even-tempered" (Proverbs 17:27)

**Key principle:** "When in doubt, shut up" - if you don't know for certain that God needs you to say something, you can always rest securely in the decision to remain silent. Pride and words do not go well together.

### Understanding Ecclesiastes: Finding Meaning

On the surface, Ecclesiastes appears to be one of the most depressing books in the Bible:

- **Repeated refrain:** "Everything is meaningless" (vanity of vanities)
- **The surface reading:** Life, wisdom, work, relationships - all appear meaningless without God

**Traditional interpretation:** The book uses a "bait and switch" technique - showing how everything is meaningless to demonstrate that only God gives meaning. Without God in the center, everything is vanity; with God, everything has purpose.

**Deeper layer:** The book is actually addressing the fundamental question: "What remains after we're gone?"

### The Legacy Principle (Ecclesiastes 7:1-4)

The passage about the house of mourning reveals profound wisdom about meaning:

**"A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of death better than the day of birth. It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for death is the destiny of everyone; the living should take this to heart. Frustration is better than laughter, because a sad face is good for the heart. The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure."**

**What this means:**

- **Material possessions don't last:** Fine perfume (costly possessions) gets passed on when you die
- **Legacy matters:** A good name, character, and impact on others can have eternal ripples
- **Presence creates impact:** Nobody remembers the parties you threw, but they remember when you showed up in their grief
- **The house of mourning teaches wisdom:** Being with people who are suffering, offering compassion and presence, creates lasting legacy

**Charles Burgin quote (predated by Ecclesiastes):** "A good character is the best tombstone. Carve your name on hearts, not marble."

### Sitting Shiva: The Practice of Presence

"Sitting Shiva" is the Jewish practice of being present with those in grief:

- **Primary principle:** Just be there - presence is the gift
- **Don't talk unless invited:** If you talk, you're not truly Sitting Shiva
- **Follow their lead:** If they want to talk, talk; if they don't, simply be present
- **This creates legacy:** Your good name is built by showing up when people need help

### The Source of True Meaning

Ecclesiastes reveals that real meaning comes from:

- **Not self-preservation but self-sacrifice**
- **Not accumulating possessions but building legacy**
- **Not pursuing pleasure but showing up in others' pain**
- **Not being remembered for what you had but for who you were to others**

This connects back to the foundational themes from the beginning of BEMA: the story of Scripture is not about self-preservation but about self-sacrifice, about living for others rather than ourselves.

### Authorship Questions

**Proverbs:**
- Traditionally attributed to Solomon
- More accurately, Solomon is credited with compiling the collection
- He may have written some, many, or none of them
- The text itself has subtitles indicating "The Proverbs of Solomon" for certain sections (Chapters 10-22 and others)

**Ecclesiastes:**
- Traditionally attributed to Solomon
- Hotly debated in scholarship - most scholars don't believe Solomon wrote it
- Some debate whether the introduction and conclusion were added later
- Regardless of authorship, it's part of the wisdom tradition associated with Solomon's legacy

## Examples & Applications

### The Proverb Exercise

In Bible college, Marty was assigned to read through Proverbs with seven different colored highlighters, finding seven different themes and highlighting every proverb that fit each theme. This exercise revealed recurring patterns:

- Wealth and riches
- Family relationships
- The power of speech
- Wisdom vs. foolishness
- Work and diligence
- The fear of the Lord
- Justice and righteousness

This approach transforms Proverbs from random wisdom sayings into an organized teaching tool on life's major themes.

### Speech and Restraint

The theme of speech particularly impacted Marty in Bible college. As someone who "makes a living with words," he learned that "pride and words do not go well together."

**Practical application:** "When in doubt, shut up" - if you don't know for certain that God needs you to speak, you can rest securely in silence.

**Real-world connection:** Chris McNaught's book "Less Is More Than Enough" applies minimalism to speech. McNaught, a counselor and college professor, demonstrates how restraint in words enhances rather than diminishes impact.

### The Apple "Why" Example

Simon Sinek's TED Talk "Start With The Why" illustrates the principle that meaning matters more than product:

- Apple's success comes from advertising the "why" (purpose, meaning, lifestyle) rather than just features
- Their Christmas commercials showed people making holiday videos - the iPhone was incidental to the story of connection
- Companies that understand their "why" create lasting impact, just as individuals who understand their "why" find meaning

### The House of Mourning vs. The House of Feasting

**Practical scenario:** You have a choice between attending a party (house of feasting) or a funeral/sitting with someone in grief (house of mourning).

**Ecclesiastes wisdom:** Choose the house of mourning because:
- Nobody will remember the party when you're dead
- People will remember that you showed up when they needed someone
- Your legacy is built in moments of compassion, not moments of pleasure
- Presence in suffering creates eternal ripples

**Modern application:** In our culture, we often avoid grief and discomfort. We prefer parties to funerals, celebration to lament. Ecclesiastes challenges us to reverse this - not to abandon joy, but to recognize that meaning is found in sacrificial presence with those who suffer.

### The Proverbs 31 Woman

Often misunderstood as a checklist for women, Rachel Held Evans provides a fresh perspective in "A Year of Biblical Womanhood":

- She interviews a female rabbi about Proverbs 31
- The passage is better understood as Lady Wisdom personified
- It's the conclusion of the "two women" theme running through Proverbs
- Rather than a burden, it's a celebration of wisdom embodied in daily, practical life

### The Balance of Party and Presence

The episode acknowledges the importance of "party" (celebration, remembrance, joy) established in Leviticus. The point is not to abandon celebration but to recognize:

- **Party matters:** We must celebrate to remember where we came from
- **Presence matters more:** When we have to choose, showing up in others' suffering creates lasting legacy
- **Both are needed:** Joy and lament, celebration and compassion - but our legacy is built more in the house of mourning than the house of feasting

## Personalized Summary

This episode transforms how we understand two frequently misunderstood books of the Bible. Rather than seeing Proverbs as a collection of absolute promises or Ecclesiastes as a nihilistic rant, we discover they are practical tools for navigating the struggle of life.

Proverbs offers wisdom for daily decisions, but we must remember these are "wise sayings that are generally true" - they contain genuine insight without being universal laws. The book presents wisdom as an attractive woman calling us to life and foolishness as a seductive woman leading to death. Among its many themes, the power and restraint of speech stands out: "when in doubt, shut up" is wisdom for an age drowning in words.

Ecclesiastes, far from being depressing, addresses the deepest human question: what gives life meaning? The answer is not found in possessions, pleasure, or even wisdom itself when pursued for selfish ends. True meaning comes from legacy - from "carving your name on hearts, not marble." The house of mourning teaches more than the house of feasting because showing up in others' suffering creates eternal ripples. Nobody remembers the parties you threw, but they remember when you sat with them in their grief.

Both books ultimately point to the same truth woven throughout Scripture: life is not about self-preservation but self-sacrifice. Meaning is found not in accumulating but in giving away, not in being served but in serving, not in the house of feasting but in the house of mourning. This is how we build a good name that outlasts fine perfume, how we create a legacy that matters beyond our own lifetime.

As we continue through the redemption cycle - that ongoing struggle to trust God's story in the midst of life's challenges - we need these tools: song to keep us remembering, wisdom to guide our steps, and meaning to get us out of bed in the morning. Together, they equip us not just to survive but to thrive in a way that leaves an eternal impact on others.

The question Ecclesiastes poses to each of us is simple but profound: What will remain after you're gone? The answer lies not in what we accumulated or achieved, but in whose lives we touched, whose grief we shared, whose hearts bear the carving of our good name.

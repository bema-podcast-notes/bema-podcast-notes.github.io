### BEMA Episode -1 (2024): What Is BEMA? - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA E-1v24: "What Is BEMA?" (2024 Reboot)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon & Brent Billings  
**Series:** BEMA Discipleship Podcast  

This foundational episode serves as an introduction to the BEMA Discipleship methodology, explaining its origins, purpose, and framework. The hosts outline the journey from Marty's personal crisis of faith in the early 2000s to the development of a comprehensive biblical study approach that emphasizes Jewish hermeneutics, community engagement, and critical thinking within Christian discipleship.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Jewish Hermeneutic Approach**: The Bible must be read through its original Jewish cultural, historical, and literary context rather than through Western theological frameworks to properly understand its meaning and application.

- **Four Pillars Foundation**: BEMA is built on Text (biblical literacy), Community (radical fellowship), Discipleship (authentic following of Jesus), and Wrestling (healthy engagement with doubt and questions).

- **Holistic Study Design**: The curriculum spans five sessions covering the entire biblical narrative from Genesis to Revelation, plus church history, designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Scripture as one unified story.

- **Community-Centered Learning**: True discipleship happens in community where people can wrestle together with biblical texts and their applications, mirroring the ancient synagogue model.

- **Accessible Academic Scholarship**: Complex biblical scholarship and historical-critical methods can be made accessible to laypeople without compromising academic integrity or faith convictions.

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Jewish Hermeneutic Revolution

The core methodology centers on reading Scripture through its original Jewish context. This approach emerged from 20th-century biblical scholarship, particularly after discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls (1950s) and the work of scholars like Jacob Neusner who bridged Christian and Jewish academic traditions. Key principles include:

- Understanding biblical authors as Jewish writers addressing Jewish audiences
- Recognizing the Eastern worldview underlying Scripture versus Western interpretive frameworks
- Applying historical-critical methods while maintaining belief in biblical inspiration and authority
- Asking "Jewish questions" rather than imposing later theological constructs

##### The BEMA Platform Metaphor

The name "BEMA" derives from the Hebrew/Greek term for the raised platform in ancient synagogues where Scripture was read. This metaphor encapsulates the educational philosophy:

- **Text-Centered**: Only God's words are elevated; human interpretation remains secondary
- **Community-Focused**: The entire community gathers around to hear Scripture together  
- **Discipleship-Oriented**: Learning leads to following and action
- **Wrestling-Encouraged**: After hearing Scripture, communities wrestled together with its meaning and application

##### Five-Session Structure

The curriculum follows biblical chronology through five distinct phases:

1. **Session 1 (Torah)**: Genesis through Deuteronomy - foundational narratives
2. **Session 2 (Prophets & Writings)**: Remainder of Hebrew Scriptures
3. **Session 3 (Gospels)**: Life and ministry of Jesus in historical context  
4. **Session 4 (Early Church)**: Acts through Revelation - early Christian development
5. **Session 5 (Church History)**: Bridge from biblical times to contemporary Christianity

##### Spiritual Formation Integration

BEMA intentionally connects biblical study with spiritual practices (disciplines) including:

- Sabbath observance and rhythm
- Prayer and contemplative practices
- Generosity and hospitality
- Community engagement and radical fellowship
- Vocational sanctity (finding sacred purpose in daily work)

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Context Application

Rather than reading Old Testament laws as arbitrary divine commands, the Jewish hermeneutic reveals them as wisdom literature addressing specific cultural challenges. For example, dietary laws become health and community identity markers rather than legalistic restrictions.

##### Community Model

The discussion group network demonstrates practical community formation, where geographically diverse people gather regularly to process biblical content together, mirroring ancient synagogue practices in contemporary contexts.

##### Vocational Integration

The "sanctity of vocation" concept helps participants connect biblical principles with their daily work, whether as engineers, artists, parents, or business owners, seeing all legitimate work as potentially sacred service.

##### Generational Focus

The emphasis on college students recognizes this demographic's unique position - autonomous enough to make independent decisions but flexible enough to incorporate new frameworks before establishing rigid patterns.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Advanced Hermeneutical Studies

- Comparative analysis of Jewish interpretive methods (Peshat, Remez, Drash, Sod)
- Historical development of Christian supersessionism and its alternatives
- Contemporary Jewish-Christian dialogue in biblical scholarship
- Impact of archaeological discoveries on biblical interpretation

##### Community Dynamics Research  

- Effectiveness of online versus in-person discussion groups
- Cross-cultural applications of Western educational methods to biblical content
- Intergenerational learning dynamics in faith communities
- Conflict resolution within diverse interpretive communities

##### Spiritual Formation Methodologies

- Integration of ancient spiritual disciplines with contemporary psychology
- Measurement and assessment of spiritual growth and maturity
- Role of doubt and questioning in healthy faith development
- Relationship between intellectual study and experiential faith

##### Cultural and Contextual Applications

- Adaptation of Jewish hermeneutics for non-Western cultures
- Application to contemporary social justice issues
- Integration with other academic disciplines (sociology, anthropology, psychology)
- Implications for church structure and leadership models

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Historical Development**: How did 20th-century biblical scholarship, particularly discoveries like the Dead Sea Scrolls and the work of scholars like Jacob Neusner, contribute to the development of Jewish hermeneutical approaches in Christian education?

2. **Methodological Analysis**: Explain how the four pillars of BEMA (Text, Community, Discipleship, Wrestling) work together to create a comprehensive learning environment. How might weakness in one pillar affect the others?

3. **Cultural Translation**: What are the potential benefits and challenges of applying a Jewish hermeneutical approach to Scripture interpretation in predominantly Gentile Christian communities? How might this approach address or create theological tensions?

4. **Educational Philosophy**: Compare and contrast the BEMA platform metaphor with traditional Western educational models. How does centering learning around Scripture reading rather than teaching/preaching change the educational dynamic?

5. **Practical Implementation**: Given the five-session structure spanning the entire biblical narrative, how might participants maintain continuity and avoid information overload while preserving the intentional pacing that prevents "opening the fire hydrant" of information?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This introductory episode establishes BEMA as more than just another Bible study - it represents a comprehensive educational philosophy rooted in historical-critical scholarship while maintaining faith convictions. The journey from Marty's personal faith crisis to developing a systematic approach highlights how authentic questions and intellectual honesty can strengthen rather than weaken faith when pursued within supportive community structures.

The emphasis on Jewish hermeneutics isn't about cultural appropriation but about reading texts within their original context - a principle that applies beyond biblical studies to any historical literature. The four pillars provide a balanced framework that prevents the common pitfalls of either purely academic study (lacking community and application) or purely experiential faith (lacking intellectual rigor and textual grounding).

Perhaps most significantly, the wrestling pillar legitimizes doubt and questioning as essential components of mature faith rather than threats to be suppressed. This creates space for honest intellectual engagement with difficult passages and theological tensions, fostering communities where faith can be both examined and deepened simultaneously. The practical structure of five sessions provides a roadmap for sustained engagement with Scripture that builds systematically while maintaining narrative coherence across the entire biblical corpus.

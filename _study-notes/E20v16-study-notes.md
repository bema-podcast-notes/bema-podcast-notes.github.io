### BEMA Episode 20: With All Your Heart - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 20: With All Your Heart (2017)  
**Scripture Focus:** Exodus 14-15  
**Main Topics:** The Israelites crossing the Red Sea, the first wilderness test at Marah, and understanding biblical testing as experiential knowing rather than pass/fail evaluation.

#### Key Takeaways

- The "Red Sea" is actually the "Sea of Reeds" (Hebrew: Yam Suph), though the exact location remains debated among scholars
- God's testing is not about pass/fail but about experiential knowing (yada) - God wants to experience what's in our hearts
- The threefold coming of God's kingdom requires: (1) the finger of God working, (2) calling on the name of the Lord, and (3) responding in obedience
- Every wilderness test is designed to teach aspects of community and how obedience impacts communal life
- Waiting on "every word from the mouth of the Lord" means trusting God's timing for provision rather than demanding immediate sustenance

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tale of Two Kingdoms

**Empire vs. Shalom:**
- **Empire:** Fear, coercion, dominating power (symbolized by Pharaoh's outstretched hand with a stick)
- **Shalom:** Trust, invitation, power through self-sacrifice (symbolized by God's deliverance)

##### The Threefold Coming of the Kingdom

Based on Jewish teaching, the kingdom of God comes through three essential elements:

1. **The Finger of God Works** - Divine intervention and power (referenced by Egyptian magicians in Exodus)
2. **Calling on the Name of the Lord** - Recognition and worship of God as Lord (*Adonai emloch ha'olam va'ed* - "The Lord reigns forever and ever")
3. **Responding in Obedience** - Active submission to God's will through righteous living

##### Biblical Testing (Nisah)

**Hebrew Understanding of Testing:**
- Not pass/fail evaluation but opportunity for experiential knowing
- **Yada** - intimate, experiential knowledge (same word used for sexual intimacy)
- Two-way gift exchange:
  - **Gift to God:** Showing Him what's in our hearts
  - **Gift from God:** Learning new lessons about His character and ways

##### The Geography of Exodus

**Route Details:**
- Israelites initially headed east from Goshen
- God commanded them to turn south toward the sea (appearing lost/confused to Pharaoh)
- This strategic misdirection prompted Pharaoh's pursuit
- Crossing occurred at an unknown location along the Red Sea/Sea of Reeds

#### Examples & Applications

##### The First Wilderness Test: Marah (Exodus 15:22-27)

**The Situation:**
- Three days without water after crossing the sea
- Arrived at Marah where water was bitter/undrinkable
- People grumbled against Moses

**The Lesson:**
- **Marah** means both "bitter" and "rebellious" - dual symbolism of bitter water and rebellious hearts
- Moses threw wood (not his staff) into water, making it sweet
- God established "law and statute" - according to midrash, requiring community care (letting sick, elderly, and marginalized drink first)

**The Provision:**
- Immediately after the test, they found Elim with 12 springs (one for each tribe) and 70 palm trees (communal sufficiency)
- Demonstrates God's abundant provision when His people wait on His word

##### Modern Applications of the Threefold Kingdom

**Contemporary Challenges:**
- Some people live righteously but never acknowledge God as Lord (missing element #2)
- Many Christians claim God as Lord but don't respond in obedience (missing element #3)
- True kingdom requires all three elements working together

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Historical and Archaeological Studies
- Archaeological evidence for Exodus route and Red Sea crossing locations
- Ancient Egyptian records of Hebrew departure and Red Sea events
- Comparative analysis of ancient Near Eastern crossing narratives

##### Theological Deep Dives
- Relationship between divine sovereignty and human testing
- Community ethics in wilderness narratives
- Typological connections between Exodus and Jesus' ministry

##### Hebrew Language and Culture
- Further study of *yada* (experiential knowing) throughout Scripture
- Exploration of *levav* (heart as will/seat of decision-making)
- Rabbinic interpretation methods (midrash) and their applications

##### Practical Applications
- Implementing community-first ethics in modern church contexts
- Understanding trials as opportunities for spiritual growth rather than punishment
- Balancing trust in God's provision with responsible action

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **What is the difference between the Hebrew concept of testing (nisah) and Western understanding of testing, and why is this distinction important for understanding God's relationship with His people?**

2. **Explain the threefold coming of the kingdom and provide examples of how each element might be missing in contemporary Christian life. How did Jesus teach this concept?**

3. **What was the significance of the location change from bitter waters at Marah to abundant provision at Elim, and what does this teach about God's timing and provision?**

4. **How does the Hebrew word *yada* (experiential knowing) change our understanding of why God tests His people, given that He already knows all things intellectually?**

5. **What role did community care play in the first wilderness test at Marah, and how does this connect to the broader theme that every wilderness test teaches aspects of community life?**

#### Personal Summary

Episode 20 presents the dramatic crossing of the Red Sea as more than just a miraculous rescue - it's the beginning of Israel's education in kingdom living. The transition from Egypt to wilderness represents moving from empire's way of fear and coercion to Shalom's way of trust and invitation. God's testing isn't about our performance but about intimate relationship - He wants to experience what's truly in our hearts, not just know it intellectually.

The story of Marah reveals God's teaching method: apparent scarcity followed by abundant provision, but only after the lesson is learned. The bitter water becoming sweet through Moses' wood, followed immediately by twelve springs and seventy palm trees at Elim, demonstrates that God's delays aren't denials. He provides exactly what we need exactly when we need it, often exceeding our expectations when we learn to wait on His word.

The threefold coming of the kingdom challenges both secular righteousness and shallow Christianity. True kingdom living requires divine power, authentic worship, and obedient action working together. This ancient wisdom speaks directly to modern discipleship, calling us beyond mere intellectual belief to experiential partnership with God in putting the world back together.

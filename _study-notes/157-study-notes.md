# BEMA Episode 157: 2 Corinthians - Apostleship

## Title & Source Summary

This episode provides an overview of Paul's second letter to the Corinthians (which is actually at least his third letter to them), focusing on the central theme of apostolic authority. Marty Solomon and Brent Billings explore how Paul defends his apostleship against critics in Corinth who questioned his authority and credibility. The discussion includes Paul's famous "thorn in the flesh" passage, his credentials as an apostle, and his understanding that true spiritual authority is validated through suffering and self-sacrifice rather than impressive credentials or eloquent speech.

## Key Takeaways

- 2 Corinthians is actually at least Paul's third letter to the Corinthians, as evidenced by references to previous correspondence in 1 Corinthians 5:9
- Paul's "thorn in the flesh" remains mysterious, with theories ranging from blindness to a deserting wife to his calling to minister to Gentiles
- The central theme of 2 Corinthians is Paul's defense of his apostolic authority against critics who found him unimpressive in person
- Paul argues that true apostolic credentials are validated through suffering and self-sacrifice, not impressive rhetoric or human achievements
- The Corinthians had grown and repented from their earlier issues, showing that even difficult church situations can change
- Paul demonstrates humility by referring to his opponents as "super-apostles" while maintaining his own apostolic authority
- Spiritual authority should be exercised for building up rather than tearing down the church
- In a post-modern context that rejects all authority, Paul's words challenge us to recognize legitimate spiritual leadership while avoiding both abuse and complete rejection of authority

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Chronology of Paul's Corinthian Correspondence

Paul's references to previous letters reveal that our biblical "1 and 2 Corinthians" are actually later letters in an ongoing correspondence. 1 Corinthians 5:9 references an earlier letter about not associating with sexually immoral people. This missing correspondence highlights how much of the apostolic writings we don't possess and reminds us that our canonical letters are part of larger pastoral relationships.

### Paul's "Thorn in the Flesh"

Paul describes receiving a "thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan" to prevent him from becoming conceited due to his revelations (2 Corinthians 12:7). Various theories exist about its nature:

- Physical ailment such as blindness (supported by Galatians 4:15 where he says they would have torn out their eyes for him)
- A deserting wife (suggested by Jewish requirements for rabbinical students to be married)
- His difficult calling to minister to Gentiles (based on Old Testament usage of "thorn in the side" referring to pagan nations)

The mystery itself may be the point - Paul's weakness becomes a source of strength and testimony to God's sufficient grace.

### The Nature of Apostolic Authority

Paul defends his apostleship against critics who dismissed him as unimpressive in person despite his forceful letters. His defense strategy is counterintuitive: rather than boasting in credentials or supernatural experiences, he boasts in his weaknesses and sufferings. This reflects the upside-down nature of God's kingdom where strength is found in weakness.

### The "Super-Apostles" Controversy

Paul sarcastically refers to his opponents as "super-apostles" who apparently impressed the Corinthians with their rhetoric and self-promotion. Paul deliberately chose not to accept financial support from the Corinthians, which may have been interpreted as a sign of his inferiority. His refusal to burden them financially becomes part of his defense of genuine apostolic ministry.

### Authority for Building Up, Not Tearing Down

Paul's approach to authority emphasizes its constructive purpose. He repeatedly states that his authority from the Lord is "for building you up and not for tearing you down" (2 Corinthians 10:8, 13:10). This principle challenges all forms of spiritual leadership to evaluate their use of authority by its fruit in people's lives.

## Examples & Applications

### The Challenge of Spiritual Authority in Modern Context

The episode acknowledges the legitimate skepticism toward spiritual authority in contemporary culture, especially given widespread abuse by religious leaders. However, it calls for discernment rather than wholesale rejection of spiritual authority, praying for leaders who demonstrate Christ-like character through humility, mercy, patience, and willingness to suffer for others.

### Paul's Missionary Strategy and Financial Ethics

Paul's refusal to accept payment from the Corinthians while accepting support from other churches (he "robbed other churches" to serve Corinth for free) demonstrates his strategic approach to removing obstacles to the gospel. This principle applies to modern ministry decisions about compensation and financial relationships.

### The Paradox of Weakness and Strength

Paul's statement "when I am weak, then I am strong" challenges cultural assumptions about leadership and effectiveness. This principle applies beyond pastoral ministry to any form of leadership or service where vulnerability and dependence on God can become sources of authentic strength.

### Spiritual Gifts and Church Diversity

The episode concludes with thoughtful reflections on spiritual gifts, acknowledging that while something special was happening in Corinth with miraculous gifts (not mentioned in other Pauline letters), this doesn't mean God isn't working differently in different places today. This models how to navigate theological differences within the body of Christ without dismissing other believers' experiences.

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration

### The Historical Context of Greco-Roman Rhetoric

Study of how Paul's defense of his speaking style relates to contemporary expectations of public oratory and philosophical teaching in Corinth, including the role of financial patronage in teacher-student relationships.

### The Jewish Background of Rabbinical Training

Investigation of the requirements for Jewish rabbinical students, particularly the expectation of marriage, and how this might inform our understanding of Paul's personal circumstances and calling.

### The Theology of Divine Weakness

Exploration of how Paul's "power made perfect in weakness" theme connects to broader biblical theology of God's strength demonstrated through apparent weakness (the cross, incarnation, etc.).

### Comparative Study of Paul's Other Letters

Analysis of why spiritual gifts are prominently featured in Corinthians but not in Romans, Ephesians, Philippians, or Colossians, and what this reveals about the unique situation in Corinth.

### The Development of Church Authority Structures

Historical study of how apostolic authority evolved into later forms of church government and the implications for contemporary discussions about spiritual authority and accountability.

3. What are the various theories about Paul's "thorn in the flesh," and how does each theory relate to different aspects of Paul's ministry and background?

4. How does Paul's statement that his authority is "for building you up and not for tearing you down" apply to contemporary discussions about spiritual leadership and authority?

5. According to the episode, how should modern believers navigate the tension between legitimate skepticism toward spiritual authority (due to abuse) and the biblical call to respect godly leadership?

## Brief Personalized Summary

This episode tackles one of the most challenging aspects of Christian life: spiritual authority and leadership. Paul's defense of his apostleship in 2 Corinthians reveals a radical understanding of leadership that turns worldly expectations upside down. True spiritual authority is validated not through impressive credentials, eloquent speech, or miraculous experiences, but through faithful suffering and self-sacrificial service. Paul's willingness to appear weak and unimpressive while maintaining his apostolic authority provides a model for authentic Christian leadership. The episode's conclusion thoughtfully addresses how this applies in our contemporary context, where legitimate concerns about abuse of authority must be balanced with recognition that God still calls and empowers spiritual leaders. The key insight is that we need leaders who look like Jesus - humble, merciful, and willing to suffer for others - and when God provides such leadership, we should be willing to follow. This challenges both the abuse of authority and the complete rejection of spiritual leadership, calling for discernment and maturity in how we understand and respond to God-given authority in the church.

# BEMA Episode 1: Trust the Story - Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 1 - Trust the Story (2016)    
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings    
**Topic:** An analysis of the Genesis 1 creation narrative as an ancient Hebrew poem, focusing on its literary structure, cultural context, and theological meaning regarding rest, identity, and God's view of creation.

## Key Takeaways

- Genesis 1 is not a scientific account but an ancient Mesopotamian/Hebrew poem with sophisticated literary structure
- The creation narrative is organized as a chiasm (mirror structure) with the word "moad" (sacred times/seasons) at its center
- The story addresses liberated Hebrew slaves, teaching them their worth comes from being God's beloved creation, not their productivity
- Sabbath rest is the central message - we are valued for who we are, not what we produce
- The "evening and morning" refrain reflects Jewish understanding that each day begins with rest, not work
- Creation is fundamentally "good" (tov), not perfect in a static sense but dynamic with potential
- The seventh day has no closing refrain, suggesting God's invitation to eternal Sabbath rest continues

## Main Concepts & Theories

### Literary Structure - Chiasm

The Genesis 1 creation account is structured as a sophisticated chiasm (mirror literary structure):

- **Days 1-3:** Separation phase (light/dark, waters, land/sea)  
- **Days 4-6:** Filling phase (sun/moon/stars, sea creatures/birds, land animals/humans)
- **Correspondence:** Day 1↔Day 4, Day 2↔Day 5, Day 3↔Day 6
- **Center:** The Hebrew word "moad" (sacred times/seasons) appears at the exact center of the poem

### Hebrew Wordplay and Patterns

The poem contains intricate numerical patterns:

- **Patterns of 3:** Three aspects of God (creator/bara, spirit/ruach, word), three days of separation, three days of filling
- **Patterns of 7:** First verse has 7 Hebrew words, second verse has 14 words (7x2), "Earth" appears 21 times (7x3)
- **Patterns of 10:** "And God said" appears 10 times, "according to its kind" appears 10 times

### Cultural Context - Egyptian Slavery

The original audience were Hebrew slaves recently liberated from Egypt who:

- Worked seven days a week making bricks for 430 years
- Had their value determined solely by productivity
- Needed to learn their worth came from being God's beloved creation, not their output
- Required deprogramming from a production-based identity system

### Theological Framework - Rest vs. Production

**Egyptian Narrative:** Value = Productivity (brick-making capacity)
**God's Narrative:** Value = Beloved creation status
**Sabbath Purpose:** Remembering identity comes from who we are, not what we do

## Examples & Applications

### Modern Parallels to Egyptian Slavery

- Career-based identity ("I am what I do")
- Worth tied to achievements, possessions, appearance
- Cultural pressure for constant productivity and improvement
- Social media validation through performance metrics
- Academic or professional achievement as primary self-worth

### Practical Sabbath Implementation

**What Sabbath Includes:**

- Rest and play without productivity goals
- Activities that remind us we are loved regardless of output
- Intentionally "not doing" things that tie worth to performance
- Celebrating creation as good without needing to "fix" or improve it

**What Sabbath Avoids:**

- Work that contributes to identity-building through production
- Activities done from obligation rather than joy
- Treating Sabbath as another performance to master

### Evening-Morning Rhythm

Jewish days begin at sunset, meaning:

- Each day starts with rest, not productivity
- Sleep comes before work, symbolizing trust in God's provision
- Identity is established in rest before engaging in activity

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration

### Literary Analysis

- Study other chiastic structures throughout Hebrew Scripture
- Explore additional Hebrew poetry forms and their theological significance
- Investigate other ancient Near Eastern creation narratives for comparison

### Sabbath Practices

- Historical development of Sabbath observance in Jewish tradition
- Jesus's teachings on Sabbath in Gospel narratives
- Modern applications of Sabbath in various Christian traditions

### Cultural Context Studies

- Ancient Egyptian labor systems and their impact on Hebrew identity
- Mesopotamian creation myths and their relationship to Genesis
- Hebrew concepts of time, rest, and productivity versus modern Western views

### Theological Themes

- The relationship between creation's "goodness" and the problem of suffering
- Identity formation in Scripture: being versus doing
- God's character as revealed through creation and rest patterns

## Comprehension Questions

1. **Literary Structure:** How does the chiastic structure of Genesis 1 point readers toward the central message about sacred times and seasons? What does this suggest about the author's primary intent?

2. **Cultural Context:** How would the message of Sabbath rest specifically address the psychological and spiritual needs of Hebrew slaves who had been valued only for their brick-making productivity for 430 years?

3. **Theological Implications:** What does it mean that God "rests" not from exhaustion but because creation is complete and good? How does this change our understanding of both divine nature and human purpose?

4. **Modern Application:** In what ways do contemporary Western cultures mirror the "Egyptian narrative" of productivity-based worth? How might regular Sabbath practice serve as counter-cultural resistance?

5. **Evening-Morning Pattern:** How does the Hebrew understanding of days beginning with evening and rest challenge modern assumptions about productivity and the proper ordering of work and rest in daily life?

## Brief Personalized Summary

Genesis 1 emerges not as a scientific textbook but as a profound theological poem designed to reshape the identity of former slaves. The sophisticated chiastic structure points to "moad" (sacred times) at its center, emphasizing that Sabbath rest is not merely a commandment but the foundational truth about human worth.

For people whose value had been determined solely by brick production, God's first lesson is revolutionary: your worth comes from being beloved creation, not from what you produce. The evening-morning refrain reinforces this by structuring each day to begin with rest rather than work, establishing identity before activity.

This ancient wisdom speaks directly to modern cultures obsessed with productivity, achievement, and performance-based identity. The invitation to "trust the story" means accepting that we are enough simply because we are God's good creation, worthy of divine enjoyment and celebration. The seventh day continues endlessly, representing God's eternal invitation to join in celebrating the goodness of creation rather than constantly striving to prove our worth through what we accomplish.

The core message is both simple and profound: before learning about human brokenness or divine requirements, we must first learn to rest in the fundamental truth that we are deeply loved and valued by our Creator.

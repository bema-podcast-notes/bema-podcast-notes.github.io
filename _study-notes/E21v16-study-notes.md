### BEMA Episode 21: With All Your Soul & "Very" - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 21: With All Your Soul & "Very" (2017)  
**Topic:** God's three tests of the Israelites on their journey to Mount Sinai - focusing on the tests of the soul (nephesh) and might (meod) through the manna provision and the battle with Amalek.

#### Key Takeaways

- God tests His people not to watch them fail, but to experience (yada) what is in their hearts and to teach them how to trust Him
- The three tests examine different aspects of devotion: heart (levav), soul (nephesh), and might/very (meod)
- The manna test reveals God's provision and teaches community care for the weak and marginalized
- The water from the rock demonstrates God's willingness to take judgment upon Himself for His people
- The battle with Amalek shows the importance of using all resources in service to God and community
- God's character remains consistent from Genesis through the New Testament - He always provides the sacrifice

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tale of Two Kingdoms Framework
- **Empire:** Built on fear, coercion, and the "upraised stick" of Pharaoh enforcing his will
- **Shalom:** Based on trust, invitation, and God's "shepherd stick" leading with His voice
- The Israelites are learning to transition from Empire thinking to Shalom living

##### The Three Tests of Deuteronomy 8
God tests His people in three areas to "yada" (experience/know) what is in their hearts:

1. **Heart (Levav) - Test of the Will** (Marah - bitter waters)
   - Will you trust God's word and wait for His provision?
   - Will you choose voluntary obedience?

2. **Soul (Nephesh) - Test of Your Being** (Manna and water from rock)
   - Your essence, the "you" that makes you who you are
   - Will you give your whole self to God or demand He prove Himself?
   - Putting God to the test = refusing to give Him your soul

3. **Might/Very (Meod) - Test of Resources** (Battle with Amalek)
   - All your talents, time, strength, and everything you can produce
   - Will you use all your resources for God's purposes?
   - From Genesis 1:31 - "tov meod" (very good) - your "very" everything

##### Hebrew Word Studies

- **Yada:** To know experientially, not just intellectually
- **Levav:** Heart - the seat of will and voluntary worship
- **Nephesh:** Soul - the essence of who you are as a being
- **Meod:** "Very" - all your resources, talents, and capabilities
- **Manna:** "What is it?" - God's mysterious provision
- **Tsa'aq:** Moses' cry of literal fear for his life
- **Nakah:** To strike to kill
- **Paniym:** God standing "before" (between Moses and the rock)
- **Nissi:** Banner/flag pointing to what lies beyond

#### Examples & Applications

##### The Manna Miracle - Community Care
The rabbis teach that when "some gathered much and some little," it wasn't about hoarding vs. trusting, but about community members gathering for those who couldn't:
- The sick, elderly, and disabled who couldn't gather for themselves
- The community ensured everyone had exactly what they needed
- This demonstrates the law and statute of caring for the marginalized

##### God Taking the Strike
When God tells Moses to strike the rock at Horeb:
- God positions Himself between Moses and the rock (paniym)
- Moses must "strike to kill" (nakah) - the same action he used against the Egyptian
- God says "Strike me instead of judging the people"
- This prefigures Jesus and echoes Genesis stories of God providing the sacrifice

##### Amalek's Cowardly Attack
The Amalekites attacked from behind, targeting the weak and weary:
- This violated justice and showed Empire thinking
- God later commands that the weak go in the middle for protection
- A community's obedience is measured by where they place the marginalized

##### Moses as Nissi (Banner)
Like Egyptian temple flags that pointed to where the god was:
- Moses holding up the staff pointed the people beyond himself to God
- The banner isn't the point - it points to what lies beyond
- "Adonai Nissi" - The Lord is my banner

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- The connection between the three tests and Jesus' temptations in the wilderness
- How the Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-5) relates to these three tests
- The theological implications of God consistently providing the sacrifice throughout Scripture
- The practical application of prioritizing the marginalized in modern faith communities
- The difference between testing God versus being tested by God
- Old Testament typology pointing forward to Christ's sacrifice
- The role of community leadership in protecting the vulnerable (tribe of Dan as rear guard)

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** How do the three tests (heart, soul, might) progress in complexity and what does each reveal about the relationship between God and His people?

2. **Application:** According to the rabbinical interpretation, how does the manna miracle demonstrate proper community care, and what would this look like in a modern faith community?

3. **Comparison:** How does the "tale of two kingdoms" (Empire vs. Shalom) framework help explain the Israelites' struggles in the wilderness, and where do you see these competing narratives today?

4. **Interpretation:** What is the significance of God positioning Himself between Moses and the rock, and how does this action connect to the broader biblical narrative of God providing sacrifice?

5. **Synthesis:** How does the Hebrew word "meod" (very) from Genesis 1:31 and Deuteronomy 6:5 help us understand what it means to love God with all our "might," and what are the practical implications?

#### Personal Summary

This episode reveals that God's testing isn't about pass/fail grades but about relationship and growth. Through the three tests in the wilderness, we see a God who consistently provides, protects, and sacrifices for His people. The progression from heart (will) to soul (being) to might (resources) shows an increasing depth of surrender. Most powerfully, we see God's character remain constant - from Genesis through the cross, He is the one who provides the sacrifice and takes the judgment upon Himself. The community aspects of each test remind us that faith is not individualistic but involves caring for the most vulnerable among us. The challenge for us is whether we will choose Shalom over Empire in our own wilderness moments, trusting God's provision rather than demanding proof.

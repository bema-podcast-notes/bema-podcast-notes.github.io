### BEMA Episode 18: A Tale of Two Kingdoms - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 18 - A Tale of Two Kingdoms (2017)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Guest:** Chris Marshall  
**Focus:** Understanding the biblical narrative as a contrast between empire and shalom, using Egypt as the first metaphor for empire systems.

#### Key Takeaways

- The biblical narrative presents two competing worldviews: empire (represented by Egypt) and shalom (God's kingdom)
- Egypt serves as the foundational metaphor for empire throughout Scripture
- Empire operates through fear, coercion, and making certain people expendable
- Shalom operates through trust, hospitality, and bringing outsiders in
- The Israelites initially prospered in Egypt's system but eventually became enslaved by it
- God seeks partners who "hear the cry" of the oppressed and work toward shalom
- We face the same choice daily between empire and shalom narratives
- Empire and shalom are built on fundamentally different principles and cannot be combined

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Two Creation Narratives
- **Biblical Narrative:** God speaks order out of chaos (tohu va-vohu), calling creation "good"
- **Egyptian Narrative:** Ra accidentally creates the world from murky swamp, requiring constant maintenance
- **Key Difference:** Biblical order comes from God's love and intentionality; Egyptian order requires human effort to maintain

##### The Cartouche System
- **Definition:** Egyptian symbol representing the ordered space where people live
- **Structure:** Ordered vault surrounded by watery chaos above and below
- **Pharaoh's Role:** Divine-human mediator who maintains order through his work
- **Implication:** Without pharaoh's efforts, the world would collapse into chaos

##### Empire vs. Shalom Characteristics

**Empire (Egypt Model):**
- Built on fear and insecurity
- Requires people to be expendable (poor, refugee, alien, orphan, widow, elderly)
- Operates through intimidation and coercion (pharaoh's stick/staff)
- Promises security through human effort and control
- Creates comfortable middle-class life for some at the expense of others
- Life is cheap when it serves the system's needs

**Shalom (God's Kingdom):**
- Built on trust in God's goodness
- Brings outsiders in and puts everything in proper place
- Operates through love, hospitality, and self-sacrifice
- Promises security through relationship with God
- Values all people as made in God's image
- Life is precious and sacred

##### The Land of Goshen Paradox
- **Location:** The best farmland on Earth (100+ feet of rich topsoil)
- **Egyptian Strategy:** Give nomadic Israelites the best land because they could move during floods
- **The Temptation:** Prosperity made it easy for Israelites to buy into Egyptian narrative
- **Biblical Metaphor:** One foot in waist-deep barley (prosperity), one foot in barren desert (God's way)

##### The Slavery Progression
1. **Initial Blessing:** Israelites given the richest land and comfortable middle-class lifestyle
2. **Narrative Adoption:** Israelites begin worshiping Egyptian gods and embracing empire values
3. **System Reversal:** New pharaoh "who knew not Joseph" oppresses the very people who built the system
4. **The Pattern:** Empire always eventually crushes those who serve it

##### God's Mission and Method
- **The Problem:** How to get Egypt (empire mindset) out of His people, not just His people out of Egypt
- **God's Strategy:** Give people what they want until empire reveals its true nature
- **The Cry:** God hears the cry of the oppressed, even when they don't call specifically to Him
- **Partnership Model:** God seeks partners (like Moses) who have His heart for justice

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Empire Manifestations
- Political systems that promise security through strength and exclusion
- Economic systems where some people's comfort depends on others' exploitation
- Religious systems where leaders maintain control through fear and intimidation
- Cultural narratives that make certain groups expendable for others' benefit

##### The Stick Symbolism
- **Pharaoh's Stick:** Symbol of coercive power, always held over people in threatening posture
- **Moses' Staff:** Simple shepherd's staff from the desert, representing genuine care and guidance
- **The Contest:** When staffs become snakes, Moses' staff (not snake) swallows the others

##### The Passover Choice
- **The Test:** Israelites must slaughter a lamb/goat (symbol of chief Egyptian god Amun-Ra)
- **The Risk:** Publicly declaring rejection of Egyptian religious system
- **The Decision:** Choosing to trust God's narrative over empire's promises
- **The Lesson:** Faith requires concrete actions that demonstrate allegiance

##### Contemporary Applications
- Examining political rhetoric for empire vs. shalom language
- Questioning what costs our comfort, security, and luxury impose on others
- Recognizing when we're standing "one foot in barley, one foot in desert"
- Choosing to "hear the cry" of those marginalized by current systems

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Biblical Studies
- Detailed analysis of the ten plagues as systematic dismantling of Egyptian pantheon
- Comparison of empire narratives throughout Scripture (Babylon, Rome, modern nations)
- Study of Israel's repeated attraction to empire systems despite liberation experience
- Investigation of Jesus' kingdom teachings as alternative to empire

##### Historical Context
- Archaeological evidence of Hebrew/Ibiru people in ancient Egypt
- Egyptian metallurgy and its role in ancient military supremacy
- Social structure of ancient Near Eastern empires
- Comparison of ancient empire systems with modern equivalents

##### Theological Implications
- The nature of God's judgment and mercy in dealing with empire systems
- Understanding divine partnership in social justice work
- The role of suffering in revealing empire's true nature
- Relationship between personal faith and systemic transformation

##### Contemporary Ethics
- Analysis of modern political rhetoric through empire/shalom lens
- Economic systems and their impact on vulnerable populations
- Religious authority structures and potential for abuse
- Environmental stewardship vs. exploitative resource management

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Contrast Analysis:** How do the Egyptian and biblical creation narratives differ in their understanding of who maintains order in the world, and what are the implications of each worldview?

2. **Historical Application:** Explain how the Israelites' experience in Goshen demonstrates the seductive nature of empire systems. What parallels can you draw to modern situations?

3. **Symbolic Interpretation:** What is the significance of the staff/stick imagery in the contest between Moses and Pharaoh's magicians? How does this relate to different models of leadership?

4. **Theological Reflection:** Why does God seek to reach not only the Israelites but also the Egyptians and Pharaoh through the plague narrative? What does this reveal about God's character?

5. **Personal Application:** Marty Solomon suggests we can analyze modern political speeches through the empire/shalom framework. Choose a contemporary example and explain how you would apply this analytical approach.

#### Brief Personal Summary

Episode 18 establishes the fundamental framework for understanding Scripture as "a tale of two kingdoms" - the way of empire versus the way of shalom. Egypt serves as the archetypal empire: a system that promises security and prosperity through human effort and control, but ultimately operates through fear, coercion, and the exploitation of vulnerable people. The Israelites' experience demonstrates how seductive empire can be - they initially prospered in Egypt's system before becoming enslaved by it.

The episode challenges modern believers to examine which narrative we've truly embraced. Like the Israelites in Goshen, we may find ourselves with "one foot in waist-deep barley and one foot in barren desert," enjoying empire's benefits while claiming to follow God's way. True discipleship requires choosing between these fundamentally incompatible systems, recognizing that we cannot serve both God and empire (Mammon). 

God seeks partners who "hear the cry" of those crushed by empire systems and are willing to work toward shalom - not just proclaiming God's message but becoming it through lives of justice, hospitality, and sacrificial love. This framework will continue throughout the biblical narrative as various empires rise and fall, but God's call remains constant: to choose the way of shalom over the way of empire.

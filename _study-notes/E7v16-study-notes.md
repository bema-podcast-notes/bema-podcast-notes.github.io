### BEMA Episode 7: The Preface - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**BEMA Episode 7: The Preface (2016)** - An analytical overview of Genesis 1-11, examining how these chapters function as a "preface" to the larger biblical narrative. The episode explores the literary structure, patterns, and theological themes that prepare readers for understanding the rest of Scripture through a Hebrew worldview.

#### Key Takeaways

- Genesis 1-11 serves as a "preface" to the main biblical narrative (Exodus through Revelation)
- The authors deliberately subvert familiar ancient Near Eastern stories to reframe understanding of God, creation, and humanity
- All eight sections of Genesis 1-11 form a larger chiastic structure with Noah at the center
- The preface establishes a fundamental choice between trust/rest versus obsession/mistrust
- Understanding this structure is essential for properly interpreting the rest of Scripture
- The brilliant literary design suggests divine inspiration working through multiple human authors

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### **The Three-Part Biblical Structure**

- **Preface**: Genesis 1-11 (world-building and concept introduction)
- **Introduction**: Genesis 12-50 (character introduction and plot setup)
- **Main Narrative**: Exodus through Revelation (the primary story of God's people)

##### **Genre Transformation in Genesis 1-11**

The authors take familiar ancient stories and deliberately subvert them:

- **Creation myths** become accounts of a good God creating good creation
- **Flood narratives** become stories of divine partnership rather than arbitrary destruction
- **Tower stories** become warnings about human hubris and self-reliance
- This subversion invites readers to "reframe what you think about the world"

##### **The Eight-Section Chiastic Structure**

1. **Genesis 1** (Creation) ↔ **Genesis 6-9a** (Noah's Ark)
2. **Genesis 2-3** (Adam & Eve) ↔ **Genesis 9b-10** (Noah's Curse)
3. **Genesis 4** (Cain & Abel) ↔ **Genesis 11a** (Tower of Babel)
4. **Genesis 5** (Genealogy) ↔ **Genesis 11b** (Genealogy)

##### **The Central Message: Noah as "He Rests"**

- The chiasm's center: Genesis 5:28-29, introducing Noah whose name means "he rests"
- Noah represents the solution to humanity's fundamental problem
- He embodies the principle of knowing when to stop and trusting God's story
- He becomes God's partner in saving creation

##### **Two Contrasting Patterns**

**Pattern of Trust** (Stories 1 & 5):

- Problems lead to deeper understanding
- Chiastic literary structure
- Good creation affirmed
- God knows when to stop (creating/destroying)
- Leads to rest and peace

**Pattern of Mistrust** (Stories 2, 3, 6, 7):

- Problems lead to deeper understanding
- Chiastic literary structure  
- Tragedy ensues
- Obsession replaces wisdom (with creativity, acquisition, destruction, fame)
- Leads to mistrust and brokenness

#### Examples & Applications

##### **Real-World Parallels to Biblical Obsessions**

- **Obsession with creativity** (Adam & Eve): Modern consumer culture's constant desire for more
- **Obsession with acquisition** (Cain & Abel): Competitive materialism and career rivalry
- **Obsession with destruction** (Noah's curse): Revenge cycles and inability to forgive
- **Obsession with fame** (Tower of Babel): Social media culture and self-promotion

##### **The Rest Principle in Practice**

- Learning when to stop working (Sabbath principle)
- Knowing when enough is enough in relationships, career, possessions
- Trusting God's timing rather than forcing outcomes
- Partnering with God rather than trying to control everything

##### **Literary Analysis Applications**

- Recognizing chiastic structures in other biblical texts
- Understanding how ancient authors used familiar stories to teach new truths
- Appreciating the sophisticated literary design of Scripture
- Reading with awareness of Hebrew thought patterns rather than purely Western approaches

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### **Advanced Literary Studies**

- Detailed analysis of each individual chiasm within Genesis 1-11
- Comparative study of Genesis accounts with other ancient Near Eastern texts
- Investigation of other large-scale chiastic structures in Scripture
- Examination of how this pattern continues through the rest of the biblical narrative

##### **Theological Implications**

- The doctrine of Scripture and multiple authorship under divine inspiration
- The relationship between divine sovereignty and human partnership (Noah model)
- The theology of rest and its implications for Christian living
- How the preface themes appear throughout the New Testament

##### **Practical Applications**

- Developing spiritual disciplines based on the rest principle
- Learning to identify and break cycles of obsession in personal life
- Building trust in God's goodness when facing life's tragedies
- Understanding how to be God's partner in restoration rather than trying to control outcomes

##### **Historical Context**

- The original audience's familiarity with ancient Near Eastern stories
- How these stories functioned in ancient Hebrew education and worship
- The development of Hebrew theological thought in contrast to surrounding cultures
- Archaeological findings that illuminate the cultural background of these narratives

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Structural Analysis**: How does the chiastic structure of Genesis 1-11 support the theological message about trust versus obsession? What would be lost if these stories were arranged differently?

2. **Literary Technique**: In what ways do the Genesis authors "subvert" familiar ancient stories, and why is this technique more effective than simply creating entirely new narratives?

3. **Character Development**: Compare and contrast the responses of Noah versus other characters (Adam/Eve, Cain, the Tower builders) when faced with challenges. What makes Noah's response exemplary?

4. **Thematic Integration**: How does the concept of "knowing when to stop" apply differently in the creation account (Genesis 1) versus the flood account (Genesis 6-9)? What does this reveal about God's character?

5. **Contemporary Application**: Given that Genesis 1-11 is designed to "reframe your understanding of reality," what aspects of modern worldview might need reframing in light of these ancient truths?

#### Personal Summary

BEMA Episode 7 reveals Genesis 1-11 as a masterfully crafted preface that prepares readers for the entire biblical narrative. Rather than viewing these as disconnected ancient stories, we discover a sophisticated literary structure that systematically addresses humanity's fundamental choice between trust and obsession. The eight sections form a chiasm centered on Noah, whose very name ("he rests") embodies the solution to human brokenness.

The episode demonstrates how ancient Hebrew authors took familiar cultural stories and deliberately subverted them to teach revolutionary truths about God's character and humanity's purpose. This isn't merely academic literary analysis—it's a call to examine our own lives for patterns of obsession that lead to mistrust and tragedy, while learning to embrace the rest that comes from partnering with God rather than trying to control our circumstances.

The brilliant design of this structure, especially if created by multiple authors, points to divine inspiration working through human creativity. As we prepare to move into the stories of Abraham and beyond, this preface has established the fundamental framework: will we trust God's good story and learn when to say "enough," or will we become obsessed with our own agendas and pull creation further apart? The choice that echoes throughout Scripture begins here, in these first eleven chapters that serve as the foundation for everything that follows.

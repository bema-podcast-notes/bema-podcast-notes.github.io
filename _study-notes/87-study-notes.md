# BEMA Episode 87: John — Grafted
## Comprehensive Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary

**Episode Title:** John — Grafted
**Episode Number:** 87  
**Topic:** The Gospel of John and its unique approach to communicating the message of Jesus to a blended audience of Hellenistic Jews and Gentiles in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey).

This episode explores how the Apostle John, as "Pastor to Asia," crafted his Gospel not to fill in gaps left by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, but to present Jesus in a way that would resonate with the specific cultural and religious context of his audience in Ephesus and the surrounding regions. The term "Grafted" describes John's approach to bringing together Jewish and Gentile believers into one unified understanding of who Jesus is.

## Key Takeaways

- **John wrote to a unique audience**: Unlike Matthew (Jews), Mark (Romans), or Luke (synagogue companion reading), John wrote to a blended community of Hellenistic Jews and Gentiles in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), particularly around Ephesus.

- **John was the "Pastor to Asia"**: Historical tradition and biblical evidence (including his letters and Revelation) establish John as the primary spiritual leader in Asia Minor, home to approximately 20% Jewish population living in large Greek cities.

- **The opening verses speak to two audiences simultaneously**: "In the beginning was the Word (Logos)" addresses both Greek philosophical concepts and Jewish understanding of Torah, demonstrating John's brilliant dual-audience approach.

- **The seven "I Am" statements serve dual purposes**: Each statement confronts both pagan Greek gods (Apollo, Demeter, Pan, Dionysus, etc.) and simultaneously claims that Jesus embodies what Torah represented to the Jewish people.

- **John's Gospel is layered with multiple sub-narratives**: Beyond the Jew-Gentile dynamic, John weaves in Genesis themes, Jacob parallels, and creation motifs (including the garden resurrection scene) to create a multi-dimensional portrait of Jesus.

## Main Concepts & Theories

### 1. The Grafted Gospel

**Definition**: John's Gospel represents a "grafted" approach—bringing together Jewish and Gentile believers into one family, echoing Paul's imagery in Romans 11 of Gentiles being grafted into the Jewish tree.

**Context**:
- After Jesus's resurrection, the Gospel spread from Jerusalem outward to Judea, Samaria, and eventually to "the ends of the earth" (Acts 1:8)
- Asia and Asia Minor (western and central Turkey) became major centers of early Christianity
- These regions had large Greek cities (Ephesus had 500,000-1,000,000 people) with approximately 20% Jewish population
- Unlike the Jerusalem church, which maintained a Judeo-centric identity, believers in Asia Minor lived in an assimilated, Hellenistic context

**John's Challenge**: How do you communicate the Gospel of a Jewish rabbi to people living in the heart of Greek culture and pagan worship? John's answer was to create a Gospel that speaks simultaneously to both audiences.

### 2. The Logos — Speaking to Greeks and Jews at Once

**Greek Understanding of Logos**:
- Greek philosophers (Plato, Aristotle) discussed the *logos* as a transcendent force holding the universe together
- The *logos* was understood as an impersonal, mysterious reality—something beyond mere matter
- Even Jewish-Greek thinkers like Philo of Alexandria engaged with this philosophical concept
- When John begins "In the beginning was the Logos," Greek readers would nod in agreement with familiar philosophical language

**Jewish Understanding of Word/Torah**:
- Jews spoke of Torah as existing before creation—"In the beginning was Torah"
- Torah was sometimes personified as "Wisdom" in mystical Jewish traditions
- Torah represented the mind, will, and words of God—eternal and pre-existent
- When John writes "In the beginning was the Word," Jewish readers would think of Torah

**The Subversive Twist**:
- John 1:2 begins with "He was with God in the beginning"
- The pronoun "He" transforms the impersonal *logos*/Torah into a person
- Both audiences must reconsider their understanding: "Wait—the Logos/Torah is a *person*?"
- John reveals that Jesus is the embodiment of both the Greek philosophical ideal and the Jewish Torah

This demonstrates John's genius—using the exact same text to communicate two profound truths to two different worldviews simultaneously.

### 3. The Seven "I Am" Statements — Dual Confrontation

John employs seven "I Am" statements that function as both:
1. Confrontations of Greek pagan deities
2. Claims that Jesus is the fulfillment of what Torah represented

**The Seven Statements and Their Dual Meanings**:

#### "I am the bread of life" (John 6)
- **Greek Context**: Confronts Demeter (Ceres in Roman mythology), goddess of provision and grain (our word "cereal" comes from Ceres)
- **Jewish Context**: Torah is the bread of life, like the manna in the wilderness—God's word sustains life

#### "I am the light of the world" (John 8)
- **Greek Context**: Confronts Apollo, god of light and the sun
- **Jewish Context**: Torah is "a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path" (Psalm 119:105)

#### "I am the gate/door for the sheep" (John 10)
- **Greek Context**: Confronts Janus, the two-faced god of transitions and doorways (our word "January" comes from Janus, the doorway to the new year)
- **Jewish Context**: Torah is the doorway to eternal life, the invitation to walk through into God's presence

#### "I am the good shepherd" (John 10)
- **Greek Context**: Confronts Pan, the half-goat, half-man god of the flock and fertility
- **Jewish Context**: God shepherds through His voice/word; Torah is the good shepherd that leads and guides

#### "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11)
- **Greek Context**: Confronts Asclepius, god of healing who was said to have resurrected a ruler's son and was himself raised from death
- **Jewish Context**: Torah is the resurrection and the life—keeping Torah leads to being raised in the age to come (Pharisaic teaching)

#### "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14)
- **Greek Context**: Confronts Athena, goddess of truth and wisdom whose temple sat in the center of the Pergamon library
- **Jewish Context**: Predating the Gospels by 70-80 years, there's a Jewish reference to Torah being "the way, the truth, and the life"
- **Important Note**: Jesus isn't claiming to be the only way to get to heaven, but rather claiming to be the way to *see* God—the truth that both Athena and Torah pointed toward

#### "I am the true vine" (John 15)
- **Greek Context**: Confronts Dionysus, god of wine and one of the most widely worshiped deities in the Greco-Roman world
- **Jewish Context**: Likely connected to Torah (though this connection is less documented than the other six)

**The Brilliant Strategy**: John essentially tells Gentiles, "Everything you're looking for in Apollo, Demeter, Pan, Dionysus, and all these gods—you can find in Jesus. These gods are counterfeits; Jesus is the real thing." Simultaneously, he tells Jews, "Jesus is the embodiment of Torah—He is what Torah has always pointed to."

### 4. Multiple Sub-Narratives in John's Gospel

Beyond the Jew-Gentile dual narrative, John layers additional themes:

#### Genesis and New Creation Theme
- John counts the first two signs/miracles, prompting readers to count all seven signs
- The seventh sign is the raising of Lazarus (culminating in resurrection)
- Jesus's own resurrection becomes the first sign of a new creation
- **Garden imagery**: Jesus is resurrected in a garden, where a gardener is present, and a woman (Mary—just one woman in John's account, unlike the other Gospels) comes looking for him
- This deliberately echoes Genesis: one woman, one man, a garden—pointing to new creation

#### Jacob Sub-Narrative
- The lifetime and narrative of Jesus parallels the story of Jacob
- John presents Jesus as the "new Jacob" through various thematic connections

#### The Count of Seven
- Seven signs leading to the ultimate sign of resurrection
- Reflects the seven days of creation, with resurrection as the first day of new creation
- Demonstrates John's sophisticated literary structure

### 5. Church Leadership Structure in the Early Church

**The Three Pillars**:
- Peter, James, and John formed the inner circle of Jesus's disciples (the *havurah* or rabbinical group)
- Paul references them as "the pillars" of the church in Galatians
- This wasn't just church tradition but biblically documented leadership structure

**Geographic Distribution**:
- **Peter**: Leader of the church universal, considered the "rock" on which the church was built
- **James**: Leader of the Jerusalem church, overseeing the Jewish center of Christianity
- **John**: Pastor to Asia (and Asia Minor), bringing the Gospel to the Greek-influenced regions

**Asia vs. Asia Minor**:
- **Asia**: The western coastal region of modern-day Turkey, including major cities like Ephesus, Sardis, and Pergamon
- **Asia Minor**: The interior and remainder of Turkey
- Philadelphia served as the doorway between the two regions

### 6. The Cultural Context of John's Audience

**Size and Scale Differences**:
- Jewish cities: Bethsaida (1,000-3,000 people), Chorazin (3,000-5,000 people)
- Greek cities: Ephesus (500,000-1,000,000 people)
- This represents a completely different world—small, tight Jewish communities vs. massive cosmopolitan Greek centers

**Religious Context**:
- Rome was driven by government, military power, and civic structures (the Praetorium, Colosseum)
- The Greek world was driven by pagan mythology, temples, and religious practice
- The Pantheon in Rome was tucked away and small compared to the prominence of pagan religious sites in Greek cities

**Jewish Population in Asia Minor**:
- Approximately 20% of the population was Jewish
- These were largely Hellenistic Jews who had assimilated to varying degrees
- They would align more with the "Herodian" response to Hellenism (engagement/assimilation) rather than separatism
- This created a unique cultural blend requiring a unique Gospel presentation

### 7. Text to Context — The Mission of the Gospel Writers

**The Core Principle**: The Gospel writers weren't merely trying to record events before they forgot them (they had phenomenal memorization skills). Instead, they were on a mission to help their specific audiences know Jesus the way they knew Jesus.

**The Process**:
1. Disciples received their "Ph.D. in Jesus"—years of walking with Him, learning from Him
2. They then spent years gaining their "Ph.D." in their cultural context
3. Only then could they effectively bring Text to Context—translating the Jesus story into language and imagery their audience would understand

**Why the Gospels Were Written Decades Later**:
- Not because memories were fading
- But because it took years to understand the culture deeply enough to communicate effectively
- John had to live in Asia long enough to understand Greek philosophy, pagan worship systems, and the unique challenges of a Hellenistic-Jewish community

**John's Unique Contribution**:
- Matthew's Gospel wouldn't work in Ephesus (too Jewish-centric)
- Mark's Gospel worked for Romans but not for the Greek context
- Luke's Gospel served as a synagogue companion reading
- John needed something entirely new for the grafted community of Asia

## Examples & Applications

### Example 1: The Logos in Modern Context

Imagine trying to communicate the Gospel in a modern academic setting where people are steeped in quantum physics, evolutionary biology, and philosophical materialism. You might begin by saying, "You know how you talk about the fundamental forces that hold the universe together? About the elegant mathematical equations that govern reality? Well, let me tell you about someone who *is* that ultimate reality..."

This is what John did with the *logos*—he took the philosophical language of his day and infused it with the personal reality of Jesus.

### Example 2: Cultural Translation Today

Consider how missionaries must deeply understand a culture before effectively communicating the Gospel:
- A missionary to Japan might spend a decade learning about honor/shame dynamics, Shinto traditions, and Buddhist philosophy
- A missionary to a secular European university town would need to understand postmodern philosophy, critical theory, and scientific naturalism
- Just as John spent years in Ephesus learning Greek culture, modern missionaries must become "Ph.D.s" in their context

The BEMA principle of "Text to Context" applies to all Gospel communication—we must know both our message and our audience deeply.

### Example 3: The "I Am" Statements in Modern Terms

If John were writing today to a Western secular audience, he might confront modern "gods":
- "I am the bread of life" → confronting consumerism and material security
- "I am the light of the world" → confronting scientism and human enlightenment
- "I am the way, the truth, and the life" → confronting relativism and individualism
- "I am the good shepherd" → confronting self-help psychology and therapeutic culture

Simultaneously, for Christian audiences steeped in religious tradition, he would show how Jesus fulfills and embodies the very things we've always valued in our faith.

### Example 4: Multiple Audience Communication

John's ability to speak to two audiences simultaneously has modern parallels:
- A skilled preacher addressing both seekers and mature believers in one sermon
- A Christian professor teaching evolution in a way that respects both believing and non-believing students
- A parent explaining faith to children of different ages around the same dinner table

The key is understanding your audiences so well that you can find language and imagery that resonates with multiple groups without compromising truth.

### Example 5: Recognizing Subtexts in Scripture

John's layered approach teaches us to look for multiple meanings in biblical texts:
- When we read about Jesus in a garden with Mary, we should think of Eden
- When we notice counting patterns (like the seven signs), we should consider creation themes
- When we see unusual details (only one woman at the tomb in John's account), we should ask, "Why did the author choose this?"

This reading strategy honors the sophistication of biblical authors and unlocks deeper meanings.

## Comprehension Questions

### 1. Who was John's primary audience, and how did this differ from the audiences of Matthew, Mark, and Luke?

**Answer**: John's primary audience was a blended (grafted) community of Hellenistic Jews and Gentiles living in Asia and Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), particularly around Ephesus. This differed significantly from:
- Matthew, who wrote to a Jewish audience in a Judeo-centric context
- Mark, who wrote to Romans in Rome, addressing a Roman imperial worldview
- Luke, who wrote as a companion to the *parashah* (Torah portion) readings in synagogue settings

John's audience lived in large Greek cities, were steeped in Greek philosophy and pagan worship, and represented a highly assimilated Jewish community mixed with Gentile converts. This required an entirely unique approach.

### 2. Explain how John 1:1-2 ("In the beginning was the Word...") speaks simultaneously to both Greek and Jewish audiences, and what makes verse 2 so significant.

**Answer**: For **Greek readers**, the word "Logos" connected to centuries of philosophical discussion about a transcendent, impersonal force holding the universe together—a concept discussed by Plato, Aristotle, and others. For **Jewish readers**, "Word" evoked Torah, which Jewish tradition taught pre-existed creation as the mind and will of God, sometimes personified as Wisdom.

Both audiences would initially agree with verse 1, but verse 2's opening word "**He**" is revolutionary. By using a personal pronoun, John transforms both the impersonal Greek philosophical *logos* and the abstract Jewish concept of Torah into a person—specifically, Jesus. This forces both audiences to reconsider everything they thought they knew: the *logos*/Torah is not just a concept or force, but a living person.

### 3. Choose two of the seven "I Am" statements and explain what Greek deity and what Jewish concept each statement confronts or fulfills.

**Sample Answer** (any two statements work):

**"I am the good shepherd" (John 10)**:
- **Greek deity**: Confronts Pan, the half-goat, half-man god who was the deity of the flock and fertility
- **Jewish concept**: Fulfills the idea that Torah is the good shepherd—God's word that leads, guides, and directs His people through wilderness and desert

**"I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14)**:
- **Greek deity**: Confronts Athena, goddess of truth and wisdom, whose temple sat prominently in the library of Pergamon
- **Jewish concept**: There's a pre-Gospel Jewish reference to Torah being "the way, the truth, and the life"—the path to knowing God

In both cases, John tells Gentiles that Jesus is what their gods falsely claim to be, while telling Jews that Jesus embodies what Torah has always pointed toward.

### 4. What evidence does John provide in his Gospel that the resurrection represents a "new creation," and why is this significant?

**Answer**: John provides several deliberate echoes of the Genesis creation account:
- **Seven signs**: John counts the first two miracles, prompting readers to count all seven signs, mirroring the seven days of creation
- **Seventh sign**: The raising of Lazarus, which culminates in resurrection themes
- **Garden setting**: Unlike other Gospels that mention multiple women at the tomb, John specifically mentions only one woman (Mary) in a garden, where a gardener is present

This garden scene with one woman and one man (Jesus, mistaken for a gardener) deliberately parallels Eden with one woman (Eve) and one man (Adam) in a garden. This literary construction signals that Jesus's resurrection is not just a miracle but the beginning of a new creation—the first day of God's new creative work in the world. The significance is that Jesus isn't just restoring the old creation but inaugurating something entirely new.

### 5. What does the phrase "Text to Context" mean, and why did it take the Gospel writers decades after Jesus's resurrection to write their accounts?

**Answer**: "Text to Context" means taking the biblical text (in this case, the life and teachings of Jesus—the rabbi the disciples followed) and translating it effectively into the specific context/culture of the audience.

The Gospel writers didn't wait decades because their memories were fading—they had excellent memorization skills trained through years of discipleship. They waited because they needed to:
1. First gain their "Ph.D. in Jesus"—deeply understanding their rabbi through years of walking with Him
2. Then gain their "Ph.D. in their cultural context"—living in their mission field long enough to deeply understand the philosophy, religion, challenges, and worldview of their audience
3. Only then could they effectively communicate Jesus in a way their specific audience could understand and receive

John, for example, had to live in Ephesus and Asia Minor long enough to understand Greek philosophy, the pantheon of gods, pagan worship practices, and the unique challenges of a Hellenistic-Jewish community before he could craft a Gospel that spoke powerfully to that context. The Gospels were written not just to record, but to communicate effectively—and that takes time, cultural immersion, and deep understanding.

## Personalized Summary

The Gospel of John emerges not as a simple gap-filler to the Synoptic Gospels, but as a sophisticated, multi-layered masterpiece designed for a unique audience—the grafted community of Jews and Gentiles in Asia Minor. John, serving as the "Pastor to Asia," spent years immersed in the Greek culture of cities like Ephesus, understanding both the philosophical discussions about the *logos* and the deeply embedded pagan worship of deities like Apollo, Dionysus, Pan, and Athena.

His genius lies in his ability to speak simultaneously to two audiences with the same words. When he opens with "In the beginning was the Word," Greeks hear their philosophical *logos* and Jews hear Torah—but both are confronted with the revolutionary truth that this Word is a person: Jesus. The seven "I Am" statements function as dual declarations: to Gentiles, Jesus confronts and supersedes their pantheon of false gods; to Jews, Jesus embodies and fulfills what Torah has always represented.

Beyond this primary dual narrative, John weaves multiple sub-themes throughout his Gospel—Genesis and new creation motifs, Jacob parallels, and sophisticated numerical structures (like the seven signs leading to resurrection). The resurrection scene in a garden with one woman deliberately echoes Eden, signaling that Jesus's resurrection is the first day of a new creation.

What makes John's work even more remarkable is understanding the context in which he wrote. He ministered in massive Greek cities (Ephesus had perhaps a million people) that dwarfed the small Jewish villages of the Galilee. His audience included both Hellenistic Jews who had assimilated into Greek culture and Gentile converts who were leaving behind the pagan worship that permeated every aspect of civic life.

The lesson for modern readers is the principle of "Text to Context"—the Gospel writers weren't merely recording history; they were translating the reality of Jesus into language and imagery their specific audiences could receive. This required years of cultural immersion and deep understanding. John's Gospel reminds us that effective Gospel communication requires both profound knowledge of the message and profound knowledge of the audience—a truth that remains relevant for anyone seeking to share Jesus in their own context today.

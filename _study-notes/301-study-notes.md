# BEMA Episode 301: Study Notes - "On Doubting and Locked Doors"

## Episode Overview

- **Hosts**: Brent Billings and Reed Dent
- **Primary Scripture**: John 20:19-31 (Thomas and the disciples)
- **Central Theme**: The nature of doubt and belief in discipleship
- **Key Figure**: Thomas (also called Didymus/The Twin)

## Major Themes Explored

### 1. The Character of Thomas - "Unvarnished Honesty"

#### Thomas's Previous Statements

- **John 11:16**: "Let us also go that we may die with him" (regarding Lazarus)
- **John 14:5**: "Lord, we don't know where you are going. How can we know the way?"
- **John 20:25**: "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands... I will not believe"

#### Character Analysis

- **Unvarnished speaker**: Says what comes to his mind without filter
- **Skeptical tendency**: Questions what others accept
- **Honest about limitations**: Admits when he doesn't understand
- **Possibly speaks for others**: Voices what everyone else is thinking but won't say

### 2. Two Types of Doubt and Belief

#### Cognitive vs. Lived Experience

**COGNITIVE DOUBT** (Head Doubt):

- Intellectual skepticism or questioning
- Can be a useful analytical tool
- May not affect how one actually lives
- Example: Thomas asking for physical proof

**LIVED DOUBT** (Gut/Stomach Doubt):

- Deep existential uncertainty
- Born from experience/trauma
- Affects core behavior and trust
- Example: The disciples hiding behind locked doors despite "believing"

**COGNITIVE BELIEF**:

- Intellectual assent to propositions
- "Golden ticket" faith - say the right things
- May not change behavior
- Example: Disciples being "glad" but still hiding

**LIVED BELIEF**:

- Faith that transforms behavior and living
- Deeper than intellectual understanding
- Results in action and change
- Goal: Moving from cognitive to lived belief

### 3. The Disciples' Response vs. Thomas's Response

#### The Other Disciples

- **Week 1**: Hiding behind locked doors "for fear of Jewish leaders"
- See Jesus, shown His hands and side, become "overjoyed"
- Receive Holy Spirit, given commission
- **Week 2**: Still hiding behind locked doors!
- **Paradox**: Cognitive belief with lived doubt

#### Thomas

- **Week 1**: Notably absent from the locked room (not hiding?)
- Responds to others' testimony with skepticism
- **Week 2**: Present when Jesus appears again
- **Transformation**: From cognitive doubt to lived belief
- **Response**: "My Lord and my God" - complete confession

### 4. Jesus's Response to Doubt

#### Jesus's Approach to Thomas

- **No condemnation**: Doesn't scold or shame
- **Meets him where he is**: Provides exactly what Thomas requested
- **Gentle invitation**: "Put your finger here, see my hands"
- **After provision, then challenge**: "Stop doubting and believe"

#### Pattern Similar to Woman Caught in Adultery

1. **Grace first**: Meets need/provides what's requested
2. **No condemnation**: Doesn't shame or reject
3. **Then direction**: Challenges to move forward in faith

### 5. The Nature of Seeing and Believing

#### Different Levels of Seeing

- **Seeing facts**: What Thomas had been doing
- **Seeing truth**: What happened when he encountered the risen Christ
- **Buechner's insight**: Thomas moved from seeing facts about Jesus to seeing the truth of who Jesus is

#### Jesus's Statement

- "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed" (John 20:29)
- Not condemnation of Thomas, but recognition of different paths to faith

## Key Questions for Reflection

1. **Personal Doubt Assessment**:
   - Do I have cognitive doubt with lived belief?
   - Do I have cognitive belief with lived doubt?
   - What am I actually "hiding behind locked doors" about?

2. **Understanding Others**:
   - How do I respond to people expressing doubt?
   - Can I distinguish between different types of doubt in others?
   - Do I create space for honest questions?

3. **Faith Development**:
   - What would it look like to move from cognitive to lived belief?
   - Where do I need Jesus to "meet me where I am" like He did with Thomas?
   - What am I asking to "see" before I'll believe?

## Cultural and Historical Context

### First Century Setting

- **Jewish leaders**: Religious authorities post-crucifixion
- **Locked doors**: Real physical danger for Jesus's followers
- **Thomas as "Didymus"**: Greek for "twin" - significance unclear

### John's Purpose (20:30-31)

- Writing to encourage persecuted Christians
- "These are written that you may believe/continue believing"
- Thomas represents the church's struggle with doubt amid persecution

## Theological Insights

### 1. **Doubt is Not the Enemy of Faith**

- Honest questioning can lead to deeper faith
- Doubt can be a tool for analysis and understanding
- The goal is not absence of questions but lived belief despite questions

### 2. **God's Grace Meets Us in Our Doubt**

- Jesus provides evidence when asked (hands, side, wounds)
- Grace precedes behavioral change
- Meeting people where they are vs. demanding blind faith

### 3. **Faith as Relationship vs. Position**

- Buechner: "Believing in God" vs. "Believing God"
- Position: intellectual assent (like believing world is round)
- Relationship: transformative encounter (like believing house is on fire)

### 4. **The Role of Community in Faith**

- Thomas needed the other disciples' testimony
- Isolated faith vs. communal faith development
- Speaking doubts aloud in safe community

## Notable Quotes and Insights

### From the Episode

- "Thomas is just saying what they're not saying"
- "We can have cognitive doubt and still have lived belief"
- "The disciples can be in a place of... 'yeah, we accept, we see, we're glad' and yet we're not going out and doing"

### From Buechner

- "Believing in God is an intellectual position... Believing God is something else again"
- "It affects who you are and what you do with your life like believing your house is on fire"

### From the Poem by Denise Levertov

- "Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief" (borrowed from Mark 9:24)
- "What I felt was not scalding pain... but light"
- "My question not answered, but given its part in a vast unfolding design"

### BEMA Episode 19: A Strengthened Heart - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 19: A Strengthened Heart (E19v24)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Primary Source:** "The Exodus You Almost Passed Over" by Rabbi David Fohrman  

This episode explores the deeper meaning behind the Passover story, examining God's pursuit of both the Israelites and Pharaoh's heart through the ten plagues. The discussion reveals how the hardening of Pharaoh's heart demonstrates God's relentless love and desire for all people to choose relationship with Him.

#### Key Takeaways

- God pursues not only His people but also their enemies, including Pharaoh
- The ten plagues were not just about rescuing Israel but also about giving Pharaoh opportunities to choose God
- There are two distinct Hebrew words for "hardening" the heart, each with different meanings
- God's name reveals His character: from El Shaddai (restraint) to YHWH (active presence)
- Israel is called to be God's firstborn (bechor) - a partner in spreading His values to the world
- The Passover represents a spiritual rebirth, with Israel leaving Egypt through a "bloody door"
- Monotheism differs from polytheism in offering precision and personal relationship, not just power

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Two Names of God

**El Shaddai** - The name known to the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob)
- Rabbinically interpreted as "the one who said to his world enough"
- Represents God's restraint and knowing when to stop
- The God who knows boundaries in creation and destruction

**YHWH (Yod-Heh-Vav-Heh)** - The new name revealed to Moses
- Emphasizes God's timelessness and active presence
- Represents not what God doesn't do, but what He does do
- Shows God's intimate involvement in creation rather than distant observation

##### The Two Types of Heart Hardening

**Kavod** (Heavy/Weighty)
- When someone cannot see the truth clearly
- The heart becomes heavy, stubborn, blinded
- Like being "stupid-ed" - unable to perceive what's right in front of you

**Chazak** (Strong/Strengthened)  
- When someone sees clearly but chooses to resist
- The heart is strengthened in resolve to oppose
- A conscious decision to power through despite understanding

##### Monotheism vs. Polytheism

**Polytheistic Worldview (Pharaoh's perspective)**
- Gods are disconnected from creation
- Power without precision or personal involvement
- People are observers of divine activity, not participants
- Gods are generally angry and unpredictable

**Monotheistic Worldview (Moses' message)**
- One God intimately involved with creation
- Precision demonstrates personal relationship
- God can be loved and loves in return
- Partnership between God and His people is possible

##### The Bechor (Firstborn) Concept

**Individual Level**
- Double portion of inheritance
- Double portion of responsibility
- Carries on the father's legacy and values
- Spreads the father's influence to siblings

**National Level (Israel as God's Firstborn)**
- Called to be a "kingdom of priests"
- Tasked with spreading God's values to all nations
- Not just having a message, but being the message
- Partnership with God in world redemption

#### Examples & Applications

##### The Monopoly Board Analogy

Rabbi Fohrman uses the game Monopoly to explain God's relationship to creation. Just as Parker Brothers exists outside the game board and creates it, God exists outside His creation. The game pieces (humanity) cannot fully comprehend the game maker using only the language and concepts available within the game.

##### Moses' Two Speeches Strategy

**First Speech:** "Let us go worship YHWH in the wilderness"
- Uses the intimate, relational name of God
- Speaks of love and worship
- Foreign concept to Pharaoh's polytheistic worldview

**Second Speech:** "The God of the Hebrews might strike us if we don't go"
- Meets Pharaoh at his level of understanding
- Uses familiar concepts of angry, punitive gods
- Strategic accommodation to begin dialogue

##### The Broken-Neck Donkey Law

This obscure law about consecrating unclean animals appears in the tefillin (phylacteries) alongside the Shema. It connects to the firstborn theme throughout Exodus, showing how seemingly random details often have deeper theological significance in Hebrew thought.

##### The Birth Canal Imagery

Rabbinical interpretation sees the Red Sea as a birth canal, with Israel being "born again" as they pass through. The bloody doorpost of Passover becomes a birth image - leaving Egypt in haste through blood, symbolizing spiritual rebirth into partnership with God.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Detailed analysis of each plague and the specific Hebrew words used for hardening
- The significance of timing and precision in the plagues (Pharaoh's strange requests for delay)
- Connection between Passover imagery and later Christian concepts of being "born again"
- The role of tefillin in Jewish prayer and its connection to the firstborn laws
- Rabbi Fohrman's complete teaching on why Moses might have expected Pharaoh to change
- The theological implications of God actively pursuing enemies rather than just rescuing friends
- How the bechor calling applies to modern believers and communities
- The relationship between the Exodus narrative and Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus about water and spirit

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** How do the two Hebrew words for hardening (kavod and chazak) change your understanding of the relationship between divine sovereignty and human responsibility in Pharaoh's story?

2. **Application:** What does it mean practically for a modern community to function as God's "firstborn" (bechor) in their local context, and how might this differ from simply having a religious message to share?

3. **Synthesis:** How does Moses' two-speech strategy demonstrate the importance of meeting people within their existing worldview while gradually introducing new concepts about God's character?

4. **Evaluation:** Why might God choose to pursue Pharaoh's heart through ten plagues rather than simply rescuing Israel immediately, and what does this reveal about divine priorities and methods?

5. **Connection:** How does the transition from knowing God as "El Shaddai" (restraint) to "YHWH" (active presence) reflect the broader narrative arc from Genesis through Exodus, and what might this suggest about God's evolving relationship with humanity?

#### Personal Summary

This episode fundamentally transforms the traditional understanding of the Exodus story from a simple rescue narrative to a complex demonstration of God's pursuit of all hearts - both friend and enemy. The revelation that God actively worked to give Pharaoh genuine opportunities to choose relationship challenges common assumptions about divine judgment and election.

The distinction between the two types of heart hardening reveals a God who respects human agency while also working within it. When hearts are "heavy" (kavod) with inability to see, God provides clarity. When hearts are "strengthened" (chazak) in conscious resistance, God honors that choice while continuing to work toward His ultimate purposes.

Perhaps most significantly, the calling of Israel to be God's firstborn reframes the entire purpose of divine election. Rather than being chosen for privilege, Israel is chosen for partnership - to embody and spread God's values to the world. This calling extends beyond having correct beliefs to actually becoming the living message of God's character and heart.

The episode's emphasis on God's relentless love, even for enemies like Pharaoh, provides a powerful model for how believers might approach those who oppose or misunderstand their faith. Rather than writing off opposition, the God of Exodus pursues every heart to the very end, hoping for transformation while respecting the ultimate freedom to choose.

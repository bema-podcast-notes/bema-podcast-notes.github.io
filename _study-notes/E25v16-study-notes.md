#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 25 - A Kingdom of What? (2017)  
**Topic:** Comprehensive overview of the Book of Leviticus, exploring its purpose as God's instruction manual for priesthood and understanding Israel's calling to be a "kingdom of priests"  
**Duration:** Approximately 32 minutes

#### Key Takeaways

- Leviticus is not a random collection of laws but a structured explanation of what it means to be a "kingdom of priests" as promised in Exodus 19:5-6
- The book serves as an "owner's manual in the glove box of the tabernacle" - explaining how to interact with and use the sacred space God commanded them to build
- Leviticus follows a brilliant chiastic structure with the Day of Atonement at its center, emphasizing God's removal of sin
- The fourfold role of priesthood provides a framework for understanding both ancient Israel's calling and modern believers' mission
- God's laws for dietary restrictions, clothing, and lifestyle were primarily given to make Israel visibly different from surrounding nations, not for health reasons alone
- The book balances personal holiness (front half) with caring for others (back half), demonstrating that true priesthood involves both personal sanctification and social responsibility

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Kingdom of Priests Concept
God's declaration in Exodus 19:5-6 that Israel would be His "treasured possession" and a "kingdom of priests" serves as the foundational promise that Leviticus explains. This wasn't merely having priests within the kingdom, but the entire nation functioning as priests to the world.

##### Five Sections of Leviticus Structure
1. **Atonement (Chapters 1-7):** Sacrificial system establishing right relationship with God before any other instruction can be properly received
2. **Priesthood Part 1 (Chapters 8-10):** What priests wear, do, and their higher standards of conduct
3. **Living as Priests (Chapters 11-20):** Kosher laws, purity codes, sexuality guidelines - the "priestwich" middle section
4. **How to Party (Chapters 23-24):** Sacred festivals and celebrations commanded by God
5. **Caring for the Oppressed (Chapters 25-27):** Sabbath year, Jubilee, redemption values, and social justice

##### Fourfold Role of Priesthood
1. **Put God on Display:** Dress, act, and live differently to show that your God is different from other gods
2. **Help People Navigate Atonement:** Assist others in understanding and experiencing forgiveness and right relationship with God
3. **Intercede on Behalf of Others:** Stand in the gap between God and people, pleading for mercy and grace
4. **Distribute Resources to Those in Need:** Ensure abundance flows from those who have extra to those who lack necessities

##### The Chiastic Structure of Leviticus
The book forms a literary chiasm (mirror structure) with the Day of Atonement (Chapter 16) at its center. The outer sections focus on rituals of redemption, moving inward through priesthood roles, holiness codes, with everything pointing toward God's complete removal of sin.

##### Holiness as "Set Apart" (Kadosh)
The Hebrew concept of holiness (kadosh) means "consecrated," "set apart," or "different" - not moral perfection. This understanding transforms how we read commands to "be holy as God is holy," emphasizing distinctiveness rather than perfectionism.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Ancient World Context
- Former slaves from Egypt needed education about priesthood since they were familiar with Egyptian and Mesopotamian priestly systems but needed to understand God's unique approach
- The elaborate high priestly garments (including blue robes) were deliberately impractical for desert life, designed to make the wearer visibly different
- Josephus recorded that seeing the high priest on Yom Kippur was like being "ported into another dimension"

##### Dietary and Lifestyle Laws
- Kosher food restrictions served primarily to make Israel visibly different from surrounding nations
- God explicitly states in Leviticus 19-20 that these laws were given "to set you apart from the nations around you"
- Modern applications might include tzitzit (prayer tassels) with blue threads as reminders of priestly calling

##### Festival and Celebration
- God commanded six major festivals, with only one (Day of Atonement) being solemn - the rest were celebrations
- The tent of meeting (moed) connects back to Genesis 1's "seasons" (moadim), emphasizing celebration as part of creation's goodness
- Modern believers often avoid celebration due to fear, missing God's commanded joy and remembrance

##### Social Justice Applications
- The Jubilee year and redemption laws provided systematic ways to restore people to community belonging
- Early church practices of resource sharing and care for the oppressed changed the ancient world
- Modern priesthood should involve both personal holiness and active care for marginalized people

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Detailed study of individual sacrificial offerings and their specific meanings in chapters 1-7
- Examination of the Day of Atonement ritual and its theological significance in chapter 16
- Investigation of the biblical festival calendar and its connection to agricultural cycles and historical events
- Analysis of Old Testament social justice laws and their relevance to modern economic systems
- Comparison of biblical priesthood with priesthood concepts in other ancient Near Eastern religions
- Study of how New Testament authors (especially Peter and Hebrews) reinterpret Levitical priesthood for Christian believers
- Exploration of the connection between Levitical holiness codes and Jesus' teachings on purity and righteousness

#### Comprehension Questions

1. According to the episode, what are the two main ways to approach studying Leviticus, and why does Marty choose the "10,000-foot view" approach for this podcast?

2. Explain the chiastic structure of Leviticus and why the Day of Atonement's placement in chapter 16 is significant rather than being grouped with other festivals in chapters 23-24.

3. What are the four roles of priesthood described in the episode, and how should modern believers apply each role in contemporary life?

4. Why does God give Israel dietary restrictions and lifestyle laws according to Leviticus, and how does this differ from health-based explanations often given for these rules?

5. How does the concept of holiness (kadosh) as "set apart" rather than "perfect" change our understanding of God's command to "be holy as I am holy"?

#### Personal Summary

BEMA Episode 25 revolutionizes the understanding of Leviticus by revealing it as a coherent manual for priestly living rather than an arbitrary collection of ancient laws. The central insight that Israel was called to be a "kingdom of priests" - not just a kingdom with priests - transforms how we read every dietary restriction, purity law, and social regulation. These weren't burdensome rules but practical instructions for a people called to visibly demonstrate God's character to surrounding nations.

The fourfold role of priesthood provides a powerful framework for evaluating modern discipleship: Do we put God on display through distinctive living? Do we help others find atonement and forgiveness? Do we intercede for others rather than excluding them? Do we redistribute resources to meet genuine needs? The episode challenges contemporary believers to examine whether they function as priests who draw people toward God or as gatekeepers who block access to divine grace.

Most significantly, the chiastic structure with the Day of Atonement at its center reinforces the consistent biblical message that God removes sin rather than merely managing it. This theological foundation enables everything else in Leviticus - the celebration of festivals, the care for the oppressed, and the call to distinctive living - because it establishes that relationship with God is secure, making obedience a missional response rather than a salvation requirement.

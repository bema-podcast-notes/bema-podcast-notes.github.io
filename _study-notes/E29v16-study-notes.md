### BEMA Episode 29 Study Notes: Images of the Desert — Wadi and En Gedi

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 29: Images of the Desert — Wadi and En Gedi (2017)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Focus:** This episode explores three key desert images from biblical lands: wadis (desert canyons), En Gedi (living water/maim chaim), and wadi floods. These geographical features serve as powerful metaphors for spiritual truths about trust, provision, and safety in God.

#### Key Takeaways

- The biblical deserts are not sandy dunes but rocky canyons called wadis that limit visibility and require complete trust in your guide
- En Gedi represents God as our living water (maim chaim) and calls believers to be sources of living water for others in their spiritual deserts
- Living water must come from God (springs or rain) and cannot be man-made or stored in cisterns
- The most dangerous place in the desert is not the heat but flash floods in wadis, which Jesus uses to illustrate building life on proper foundations
- Often non-believers provide more authentic support during spiritual struggles than fellow Christians
- The water ceremony at Sukkot provides context for Jesus's teaching about streams of living water flowing from believers

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Wadis: Learning to Trust Without Sight

**Definition:** Deep desert canyons carved by seasonal rainfall over thousands of years. Unlike popular imagery of sandy deserts, biblical deserts (Negev, Paran, Zin) consist primarily of these rocky canyon systems.

**Spiritual Application:** Wadis teach complete dependence on the guide because:
- Visibility is limited to 50 yards in any direction
- Every turn reveals uncertainty - sometimes rest, sometimes more barrenness
- You cannot plan ahead or see the destination
- The only choice is to trust the shepherd's voice and follow step by step

**Biblical Connection:** This mirrors our relationship with God, where we must trust His guidance without knowing the full itinerary of our lives.

##### En Gedi and Maim Chaim (Living Water)

**Definition:** En Gedi means "spring of the deer" - a natural oasis in the Negev desert where fresh spring water creates life in the middle of barrenness. Maim chaim refers to "living water" that comes directly from God.

**Characteristics of Living Water:**
- Must originate from God's power (springs from earth or rain from sky)
- Cannot be man-made or stored in cisterns
- Represents God's fresh, life-giving provision versus stagnant, human-controlled resources

**Dual Application:**
- **Vertical:** God is our En Gedi, our source of living water in spiritual deserts (Psalm 63, Jeremiah 2:13)
- **Horizontal:** We are called to be En Gedi for others in their deserts (Isaiah 32:2, Isaiah 58:11)

##### The Water Ceremony at Sukkot

**Context:** Week-long harvest festival where people brought lulavs (palm frond, myrtle, willow, citron bundle) to the temple. The ceremony involved:
- Gathering with lulavs that sound like rain when shaken
- Priest with empty pitcher ascending altar in silence
- Crowd shouting "Hosanna" (Lord, save us/grant success)
- Priest filling pitcher at Pool of Siloam
- Returning to pour water on altar amid celebration

**Jesus's Teaching:** During the silence of the water ceremony, Jesus declared: "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and streams of living water will flow from within him" (emphasis on "from within him" - we become the source for others).

##### Wadi Floods: Foundation and Safety

**Phenomenon:** Flash floods are the leading cause of death in the desert. Rain 50+ miles away can create walls of water rushing through wadis with only 40 seconds warning (sounds like an approaching train).

**Jesus's Parable Application:**
- **Sand:** Found in wadi bottoms where floods occur
- **Rock:** Bedrock/cliff faces at the top of wadis, safe from floods
- **Message:** The issue isn't building materials but location - wise people build where they're safe from spiritual floods

**Old Testament Connections:** David's imagery of being stuck in mire (wadi mud) and God lifting him to solid rock takes on literal meaning in desert context.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Personal Trust Examples
- Marty's experience getting lost with Ray Vander Laan for seven extra miles, learning to trust the guide
- The practice of not providing detailed itineraries on Israel trips to teach dependence on the leader
- Americans' struggle with control versus trust, especially in unfamiliar environments

##### En Gedi Relationships
- The practice of taking photos at En Gedi springs and giving them to people who have been "living water" during difficult seasons
- Marty's observation that non-believers often provide safer spaces for authentic struggle than fellow Christians
- The challenge of creating judgment-free environments within faith communities

##### Modern Wadi Flood Parallels
- Building careers, relationships, or identities in spiritually dangerous "low places"
- Recognizing early warning signs of spiritual danger
- The importance of establishing life foundations on solid spiritual bedrock

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Study the complete Psalm 63 in its desert context for deeper understanding of David's spiritual state
- Research the historical accuracy of the Sukkot water ceremony and its connection to harvest festivals
- Examine other biblical passages that use water imagery (John 4 with the Samaritan woman, John 7:37-39)
- Investigate the geological and ecological systems of the Negev desert and ancient water sources
- Explore the concept of "living water" in Jewish thought and its development through Scripture
- Study modern applications of being "En Gedi" for others in practical ministry contexts
- Research archaeological evidence of ancient cistern systems versus natural springs in biblical lands

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How do wadis challenge our modern approach to planning and control, and what specific spiritual disciplines might help us become more comfortable with limited visibility in our faith journey?**

2. **What is the difference between "living water" (maim chaim) and cistern water according to Jewish understanding, and how does this distinction apply to our sources of spiritual nourishment today?**

3. **In Jesus's teaching during the Sukkot water ceremony, why is it significant that streams of living water flow "from within" the believer rather than from Jesus directly, and what does this reveal about our role in others' spiritual journeys?**

4. **Why might non-believers sometimes provide safer spaces for authentic struggle than fellow Christians, and what does this suggest about how faith communities should approach those going through difficult seasons?**

5. **How does understanding wadi floods as the primary cause of desert death change your interpretation of Jesus's parable about building on sand versus rock, and what "wadi bottom" situations should modern believers avoid?**

#### Personal Summary

This episode transforms our understanding of biblical desert imagery from romantic sandy landscapes to harsh, rocky realities that demand complete trust. The three images - wadis requiring blind faith in the guide, En Gedi as oases of life-giving provision, and deadly wadi floods threatening those in vulnerable positions - create a comprehensive picture of spiritual life. 

The most challenging aspect may be recognizing that we're called not just to receive God's living water, but to become sources of living water for others in their deserts. This requires the kind of authentic, non-judgmental presence that sadly seems more common among non-believers than within faith communities. The episode calls us to examine both where we seek refreshment in our own spiritual deserts and whether we provide safe oases for others in theirs.

The geographical realities of the biblical world weren't just background scenery but intentional teaching tools that Jesus and the biblical authors used to communicate profound spiritual truths about trust, provision, safety, and community.

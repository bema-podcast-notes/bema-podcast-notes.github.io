### BEMA Episode 28 Study Notes: Images of the Desert â€” Ar'ar and Tamarisk

#### Title & Source Summary
This episode explores two significant desert plants - the ar'ar bush and the tamarisk tree - as biblical metaphors for different approaches to life and faith. Part of BEMA's series on desert imagery, this teaching uses botanical knowledge to illuminate spiritual truths found in Jeremiah 17 and Genesis 21.

#### Key Takeaways
- The ar'ar bush represents those who trust in human strength rather than God - attractive externally but empty and toxic internally
- The acacia tree symbolizes those who trust in the Lord - may appear lifeless but contain deep reserves of spiritual vitality
- The tamarisk tree teaches us about legacy and long-term thinking - doing things that benefit future generations rather than immediate personal gain
- Desert imagery in Scripture becomes more meaningful when we understand the actual characteristics of these plants
- True spiritual maturity involves planting "tamarisk trees" - investments that will benefit others long after we're gone

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Ar'ar Bush - False Promise
The ar'ar bush serves as a powerful metaphor in Jeremiah 17:5-6. This desert plant appears lush and fruitful from the outside, with bright green foliage and grapefruit-sized fruit. However, when examined closely, the fruit is completely hollow except for a toxic, milky substance around the edges. The bush represents people who "trust in man" and "draw strength from mere flesh" rather than relying on God.

Key characteristics:
- Visually attractive and promising
- Completely empty inside
- Contains toxic substances
- Found in wasteland and parched places
- Deceptive in its apparent abundance

##### The Acacia Tree - True Substance  
Contrasted with the ar'ar, the acacia tree (referenced in both Psalm 1 and Jeremiah 17:7-8) represents those who trust in the Lord. While it may appear dead or unremarkable on the surface, it contains deep internal resources that allow it to flourish when conditions are right.

Key characteristics:
- May appear lifeless or unimpressive
- Contains deep internal vitality
- Sends out roots by streams of water
- Leaves remain green (perseveres through drought)
- Never fails to bear fruit when conditions allow

##### The Tamarisk Tree - Legacy Thinking
The tamarisk tree represents generational thinking and legacy building. This "luxury tree" requires cultivation and takes 80 years to reach maturity, meaning those who plant it will never enjoy its full benefits themselves.

Key characteristics:
- Requires intentional planting and cultivation
- Takes 80 years to mature
- Provides exceptional shade (15% cooler than normal desert shade)
- Absorbs moisture from the air and creates a more comfortable microclimate
- Represents investment in future generations

##### Empire vs. Shalom Leadership Paradigm
The episode reinforces the ongoing BEMA theme contrasting two leadership styles:
- Empire: Leadership through fear, coercion, and "the stick" (like Pharaoh)
- Shalom: Leadership through voice and shepherding care

#### Examples & Applications

##### Biblical Applications
- **Abraham's Tamarisk (Genesis 21)**: After making a treaty with Abimelech, Abraham plants a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, demonstrating his faith that his descendants will remain in the promised land for generations
- **Jeremiah's Contrast (Jeremiah 17:5-8)**: The prophet uses the ar'ar and acacia to illustrate two fundamentally different approaches to life - trusting in human strength versus trusting in God

##### Modern Applications
- **Spiritual Disciplines**: Like the acacia tree, consistent spiritual practices may seem unrewarding in the short term but develop deep roots that sustain us through difficult seasons
- **Legacy Building**: The "tamarisk question" - "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" challenges us to consider what we're doing that will benefit future generations
- **Discernment**: The ar'ar bush warns us about being deceived by external appearances in leadership, relationships, or spiritual matters

##### Practical Questions for Reflection
- What "ar'ar bushes" in my life look promising but may be spiritually empty or toxic?
- How am I developing "acacia tree" characteristics - deep roots that can sustain me through drought?
- What "tamarisk trees" am I planting that will benefit others long after I'm gone?

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Biblical Botany
- Study other significant trees and plants mentioned in Scripture (cedar of Lebanon, olive trees, fig trees, etc.)
- Research the work of Nogah Hareuveni, the leading expert on biblical botany mentioned in the episode
- Explore how understanding the physical characteristics of biblical flora enhances spiritual understanding

##### Desert Spirituality
- Examine other desert imagery in Scripture (wilderness wandering, desert as place of testing and revelation)
- Study the Desert Fathers and their spiritual insights gained from desert living
- Explore how physical environments shape spiritual metaphors and understanding

##### Leadership and Legacy
- Investigate other biblical examples of generational thinking and legacy building
- Study the concept of covenant relationships that span generations
- Explore modern applications of servant leadership versus authoritarian control

##### Hermeneutical Approach
- Examine how cultural and geographical context enhances biblical interpretation
- Study the importance of understanding ancient Near Eastern customs and environment
- Explore the balance between historical-cultural interpretation and contemporary application

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Compare and Contrast**: How do the ar'ar bush and acacia tree serve as contrasting metaphors in Jeremiah 17? What specific characteristics of each plant support the spiritual lesson being taught?

2. **Application**: What does it mean practically to "plant tamarisk trees" in your daily life? Give three specific examples of activities or investments that might represent "tamarisk tree thinking."

3. **Biblical Context**: How does Abraham's planting of the tamarisk tree in Genesis 21 demonstrate his faith in God's promises? What was he communicating through this action?

4. **Spiritual Discernment**: Using the ar'ar bush as a metaphor, describe how someone might identify "ar'ar bush" situations in modern life - things that appear promising externally but are empty or harmful internally.

5. **Long-term Perspective**: The rabbinical question "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" challenges immediate gratification thinking. How does this concept relate to spiritual disciplines and the development of Christian character?

#### Personal Summary

This episode powerfully illustrates how understanding the physical characteristics of biblical flora can dramatically enhance our comprehension of spiritual truths. The ar'ar bush serves as a warning against trusting in human strength or being deceived by external appearances - things that look promising but are ultimately empty and toxic. In contrast, the acacia tree represents the person who trusts in God, developing deep roots that sustain them through difficult seasons, even when they may appear unremarkable to others.

Perhaps most challenging is the concept of the tamarisk tree, which calls us to think beyond our immediate circumstances and invest in things that will benefit future generations. Abraham's simple act of planting a tamarisk tree becomes a profound statement of faith in God's promises and commitment to generational blessing. The rabbinical question "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" challenges our natural tendency toward immediate gratification and calls us to consider the lasting impact of our daily choices and spiritual disciplines.

These desert images remind us that true spiritual maturity often involves patience, perseverance, and a willingness to invest in things whose benefits we may never fully see in our lifetime.

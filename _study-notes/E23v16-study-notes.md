### BEMA Episode 23: Falling on Joyful Faces - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 23 - Falling on Joyful Faces (2017)  
**Scripture Coverage:** Exodus 24-40  
**Main Topic:** The construction of the tabernacle as God's mobile sanctuary and its deep connections to the Genesis creation account, establishing a place of rest and divine presence among His people.

#### Key Takeaways

- The tabernacle construction parallels Genesis creation with seven "And the Lord said" statements
- The tabernacle serves as a mobile Genesis 1 story, constantly reminding God's people of His rest and presence
- The center of the tabernacle chiasm focuses on God's promise: "My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest" (Exodus 33:14)
- The grand opening of both the tabernacle and Solomon's temple resulted in people falling face down in joyful worship
- Modern believers are the new temple of God, called to be mobile reminders of God's goodness and love
- People should have the same joyful reaction when meeting God's temple today as they did in ancient times

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tabernacle as New Creation

The tabernacle construction deliberately echoes Genesis 1 creation:
- **Seven Divine Speeches:** Just as Genesis 1 contains seven "And God said" statements, the tabernacle instructions contain seven "And the Lord said to Moses" statements (Exodus 25:1, 30:11, 30:17, 30:22, 30:34, 31:1, 31:12)
- **Sabbath Connection:** The seventh divine speech addresses Sabbath observance, mirroring the seventh day of creation
- **Completion Language:** Both Genesis 2 and Exodus 39-40 use similar language about finishing work, blessing the work, and resting

##### The Tent of Moad (Meeting/Seasons)

The Hebrew word "moad" appears in both Genesis 1 (for seasons/appointed times) and as the designation for the Tabernacle as "Tent of Meeting":
- Represents the center of the Genesis 1 chiasm
- Creates a "mobile Genesis 1 story" traveling with God's people
- Establishes regular, appointed times for encountering God

##### Tabernacle Symbolism Connecting to Eden

- **Tree of Life:** The Torah (Law) in the Ark of the Covenant represents the Tree of Life
- **Cherubim:** Both guard the Tree of Life in Eden and appear embroidered on the tabernacle curtain
- **Holy of Holies:** Functions as a restored Eden where God's presence dwells behind the veil

##### Chiastic Structure of Tabernacle Construction

The tabernacle narrative forms an eight-part chiasm:
- A/A': Glory of the Lord (Chapters 24 & 40)
- B/B': Tabernacle and priestly garments instructions
- C/C': Bezalel and Oholiab (craftsmen)
- D/D': Sabbath instructions
- **Center:** Golden calf incident and God's promise of presence and rest (Exodus 33:14)

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Temple Openings

**Tabernacle Opening (Leviticus 9:23-24):**
- Fire came from God's presence
- Consumed burnt offerings
- People shouted for joy and fell face down in worship

**Solomon's Temple Opening (2 Chronicles 7:1-3):**
- Fire came down from heaven
- Glory of the Lord filled the temple
- People knelt face down, worshipped, and proclaimed "He is good; his love endures forever"

##### Modern Application - Believers as God's Temple

According to Acts, believers become the new temple through Pentecost:
- Fire from the old temple (tongues of fire) rested on the new temple (believers)
- Christians collectively form God's mobile temple
- Should provoke the same joyful response in others as ancient temples did
- Challenge: Do people fall down in joyful worship when they encounter God's people today?

##### Practical Implications for Christian Living

- Believers should be "mobile reminders of Genesis 1"
- Called to be "tents of moad" - appointed meeting places with God
- Should invite others to trust God's story through hospitality and love
- Need to examine whether our lives reflect God's goodness and inspire worship

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Detailed study of tabernacle furnishings and their symbolic meanings
- Comparison of priestly garments with Eden imagery
- Investigation of other Old Testament chiastic structures
- Analysis of Pentecost as the fulfillment of tabernacle theology
- Examination of how Jesus fulfilled tabernacle symbolism
- Study of hospitality patterns from Abraham through the tabernacle
- Exploration of Ray Vander Laan's "That the World May Know" series, particularly Volume 10

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Pattern Recognition:** What are the seven instances of "And the Lord said to Moses" in the tabernacle construction, and how do they parallel Genesis 1? What does the seventh instance specifically address?

2. **Symbolic Analysis:** Explain how the tabernacle serves as a "mobile Genesis 1 story." Include at least three specific connections between tabernacle elements and the Garden of Eden.

3. **Structural Understanding:** Describe the eight-part chiasm of the tabernacle construction. What is significant about the center of this literary structure, and how does it relate to the overall theme?

4. **Historical Comparison:** Compare and contrast the grand openings of the tabernacle (Leviticus 9) and Solomon's temple (2 Chronicles 7). What was the consistent human response, and why is this significant?

5. **Contemporary Application:** According to the episode, how should modern believers function as God's temple? What practical changes might be needed to ensure people have the proper response when encountering God's people today?

#### Personal Summary

BEMA Episode 23 reveals the tabernacle as far more than a detailed construction project - it represents God's masterful design to create a portable Eden that would constantly remind His people of His presence, rest, and goodness. The intricate parallels between tabernacle construction and Genesis creation demonstrate God's intentional callback to the perfect world He originally designed. The seven divine speeches, Sabbath emphasis, and completion language all point to the tabernacle as a new creation project.

The episode's most convicting insight comes from recognizing that believers today serve as God's mobile temple. Just as ancient people fell face down in joyful worship when encountering God's presence in the tabernacle and temple, modern encounters with God's people should provoke similar reactions of awe, joy, and proclamation that "the Lord is good; his love endures forever." This challenges contemporary Christians to examine whether their lives truly reflect the glory, rest, and hospitality that characterized God's dwelling places throughout Scripture. The tabernacle reminds us that wherever God's people go, they carry the potential to be a "tent of moad" - an appointed meeting place where others can encounter the living God and find the rest He offers to all who trust His story.

### BEMA Episode 10: Walking the Blood Path - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary
**Episode:** BEMA 10: Walking the Blood Path (E10v24)  
**Scripture Coverage:** Genesis 15-17  
**Main Theme:** The evolving partnership between God and Abraham, exploring covenant relationships, trust, and God's faithfulness despite human failure

#### Key Takeaways

- God meets us in our frustration and doubt, responding to our questions even when we're cranky with Him
- Sometimes God withholds answers because giving them would cause us to mess up our own story
- Blood path covenants were ancient Near Eastern betrothal agreements where the greater party protected the lesser party
- God walked the blood path twice - both for Himself and for Abraham - showing His willingness to pay the price for human failure
- Circumcision served as a covenant sign that removed power hierarchies and social distinctions within God's family
- Our mistakes have consequences that become part of God's story, but He works redemptively through them
- God shapes His partners gradually through their failures and successes, not demanding perfection upfront

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Pattern of Review and Narrative Understanding
The BEMA approach emphasizes understanding the Bible as a chronological narrative rather than isolated passages. Genesis 1-11 serves as the "preface" establishing foundational principles, while Genesis 12 onward tells the story of God finding a partner willing to trust His story.

##### Abraham's Character Development
Abraham demonstrates a pattern of choosing others over self-preservation:
- Rescuing his barren niece Yiska (Sarah)
- Letting his nephew Lot choose the best land
- Building altars and pitching tents (mobility and worship) rather than building towers and settling down (like Babel)
- Rescuing Lot from the kings

##### The "And Abraham Said" Literary Device
When Scripture repeats "And Abraham said" within the same conversation, it indicates a pause or break where God said nothing. This reveals Abraham's growing frustration and God's strategic silence.

##### Blood Path Covenants in Ancient Culture
These were betrothal agreements between a greater party (father) and lesser party (bridegroom):
- Animals were cut in half and arranged opposite each other
- Blood formed a path between the pieces
- Both parties walked the path, making vows
- The lesser party (bridegroom) went first
- If either failed their promise, the other could "walk in their blood"

##### The Deep Sleep Connection
Abraham's "deep sleep" (Hebrew: tardema) parallels Adam's deep sleep when Eve was formed - both involve God creating partnership/betrothal relationships.

##### The Egypt Problem
Abraham's trip to Egypt wasn't necessarily sinful, but it had consequences:
- He brought Egypt back with him materially (goods, servants including Hagar)
- He brought Egypt back in his heart (tendency to rely on his own plans)
- This led to the Hagar situation and future complications
- God would later struggle more to get "Egypt out of His people" than to get "His people out of Egypt"

##### Circumcision as Social Equalizer
The chiastic structure of Genesis 17 centers on circumcision, which served to:
- Remove power hierarchies (Avram = "exalted father" became Abraham = "father of many")
- Eliminate possessive relationships (Sarai = "my princess" became Sarah = "princess")
- Create equality when people stand naked together - no distinction between slave and free
- Establish a "kingdom of priests" (circumcision was associated with Egyptian priesthood)

#### Examples & Applications

##### Real-World Covenant Parallels
Modern marriage ceremonies echo ancient covenant-making with vows, witnesses, and symbolic acts. Wedding rings serve as visible signs of covenant commitment, similar to circumcision as a covenant sign.

##### Contemporary Trust Issues
Like Abraham's demand for "collateral" from God, we often want guarantees before trusting. God sometimes withholds information because premature answers lead to poor decisions - like giving a teenager complete freedom before they develop wisdom.

##### Power Dynamics in Relationships
The Hagar situation illustrates how unchecked power leads to abuse. Modern applications include workplace harassment, family dynamics, and social justice issues where those with power must actively work to protect the vulnerable.

##### Consequences vs. Condemnation
Abraham's mistakes had real consequences (the Hagar situation, future conflicts) but didn't disqualify him from God's purposes. This models how our failures become part of God's redemptive story without defining our ultimate destiny.

- **The Theology of Divine Silence:** Explore other biblical instances where God's silence serves a purpose
- **Egyptian Influence on Hebrew Culture:** Investigate how the patriarchs' time in Egypt shaped later Hebrew practices
- **The Development of Priesthood:** Trace the connection between circumcision, priesthood, and the kingdom of priests concept
- **Literary Devices in Hebrew Narrative:** Study chiastic structures and other Hebrew literary techniques
- **The Hagar Narrative:** Examine themes of social justice, abuse of power, and God's care for the marginalized
- **Abraham in the New Testament:** Explore how Romans 4 and Galatians use Abraham as a model of faith

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **What does the repeated phrase "And Abraham said" in Genesis 15:2-3 tell us about God's response strategy, and why might God have chosen silence in that moment?**

2. **Explain the significance of God walking the blood path covenant twice. What does this action reveal about God's character and His relationship with humanity?**

3. **How does the chiastic structure of Genesis 17 support the interpretation that circumcision was meant to eliminate power hierarchies within God's covenant family?**

4. **In what ways did Abraham's experience in Egypt create long-term consequences for his family story, and how does this principle apply to our own life choices?**

5. **Compare and contrast the ancient blood path covenant with modern marriage ceremonies. What universal principles about covenant relationships do both practices reveal?**

#### Personal Summary

Genesis 15-17 reveals a God who meets us in our frustration and doubt while strategically guiding our spiritual development. Abraham's journey from demanding answers to trusting God's timing illustrates the messy reality of faith partnership. The blood path covenant demonstrates God's willingness to bear the consequences of human failure, prefiguring the Gospel message. Meanwhile, the institution of circumcision shows God's commitment to social justice and equality within His covenant community. This narrative reminds us that God uses our mistakes redemptively while gradually shaping us into the partners He needs to bless all nations. The story challenges us to trust God's timing, acknowledge the real consequences of our choices, and work actively to eliminate power imbalances that lead to injustice.

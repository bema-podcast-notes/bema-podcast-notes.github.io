### BEMA Episode 24: Creating a Space - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary
**BEMA Episode 24: Creating a Space (2025)**
This episode explores the concept of spiritual practices as a means of creating space for God in our lives, using the Tabernacle as a metaphor. The hosts discuss various spiritual disciplines that help believers develop intimacy with God and community with others, moving beyond traditional approaches to prayer and Bible study to embrace a broader spectrum of spiritual practices.

#### Key Takeaways
- The Tabernacle serves as a model for creating sacred space - God asks us to create space, and He will fill it
- Spiritual practices are not about religious performance but about developing authentic intimacy with God
- Success is defined as "developing intimacy with God and community with each other through a living relationship with Jesus"
- We should focus on a few sustainable practices rather than attempting to do everything at once
- Different seasons of life call for different spiritual disciplines
- Creating space for God requires intentionality in our busy, distracted culture

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Tabernacle as Mobile Genesis
- The Tabernacle represents a "mobile Genesis 1, 2, and 3" - a portable Garden of Eden
- In creation, God created space and asked humanity to fill it; with the Tabernacle, God asks us to create space and He will fill it
- This reversal represents a fundamental shift in the divine-human relationship after the Fall

##### Impact Campus Ministries' Definition of Success
- "Success is developing intimacy with God and community with each other through a living relationship with Jesus"
- Individuals developing intimacy with God in Christian community will naturally make an impact for the kingdom
- Ministry should be the product of our love for God, not crowd out intimacy with God
- We cannot control impact or fruitful ministry, but we have absolute control over developing intimacy with God

##### Categories of Spiritual Practices

###### Prayer Practices
- **Prayer Journaling**: Documenting prayers to track God's work over time (like "spiritual flossing")
- **Fixed-Hour Prayer**: Setting alarms throughout the day (9am, 12pm, 3pm, 6pm, 9pm) to pause and pray
- **Contemplative Prayer**: Including centering prayers like "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner"
- **Praying the Text**: Using Scripture (especially Psalms) as the foundation for prayer

###### Practices of Presence
- **Solitude, Sabbath, and Silence**: Creating space to become more aware of God's love and grace than life's demands
- **Practicing the Presence of God**: Learning to be constantly aware of God as companion throughout daily activities
- **Simplicity**: Resisting acquisition, complexity, consumption, and hurry through intentional pursuit of a simple life

###### Other Spiritual Disciplines
- **Generosity**: Seasons of intentional giving as a spiritual practice, not just charity
- **Submission**: Choosing to submit to leadership or circumstances as a means of spiritual formation
- **Gratitude**: The Jewish practice of saying 70 blessings per day as expressions of thankfulness
- **Meditating and Memorizing**: Focusing on Scripture passages and committing them to memory (without "stacking")
- **Spiritual Direction**: Formal relationships with trained spiritual companions
- **Seasonal Practices**: Including fasting, feasting, and following the church calendar

##### Key Insights on Fasting
- Fasting is not about becoming "more spiritual" but about being humbled and broken down
- We should fast in response to something (grief, need for humility) rather than to achieve something
- Fasting strips away pride and connects us to our humanity, making us more ready to hear God

#### Examples & Applications

##### Bill's Challenge Story
Marty's mentor Bill challenged him to sit by a lake for eight hours with just a Bible and lunch, only opening the Bible if God prompted him. This experience taught Marty the power of creating space for God and led to a life-changing realization about neglecting his wife.

##### Fixed-Hour Prayer in Practice
At Impact Campus Ministries conferences, staff set phone alarms for regular prayer times. When the alarm sounds during conversations or projects, it brings immediate perspective and awareness of God's presence.

##### Sabbath and Simplicity Integration
Josh describes how preparation for Sabbath meals can become overly complex, defeating the purpose of rest. The practice of simplicity informs how to approach Sabbath - enjoying good things without unnecessary stress.

##### Christian Reputation and Tipping
The hosts address the poor reputation Christians have as restaurant customers on Sundays, suggesting that generous tipping can be transformed from a transaction into a spiritual practice of generosity.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Jewish Spiritual Practices**: Deeper study of Shema, blessing practices, and Torah-based spiritual disciplines
- **Church Calendar Integration**: How Advent, Lent, and other liturgical seasons can shape spiritual formation
- **Community vs. Individual Practices**: Exploring spiritual disciplines that can be practiced in groups
- **Cultural Barriers to Spiritual Practice**: How modern culture of productivity and consumption interferes with spiritual formation
- **Spiritual Direction Training**: Understanding how to find and work with spiritual directors
- **Fasting Variations**: Different types of fasting (food, media, consumption) for various spiritual purposes

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How does the metaphor of the Tabernacle as "mobile Genesis" help us understand the purpose of spiritual practices in creating space for God?**

2. **What is the difference between Impact Campus Ministries' definition of success and typical ministry success metrics, and why is this distinction important?**

3. **Why do the hosts recommend choosing only a few spiritual practices at a time rather than attempting to implement many disciplines simultaneously?**

4. **According to the episode, what is the true purpose of fasting, and how does this differ from common misconceptions about fasting as a spiritual discipline?**

5. **How do the "practices of presence" (solitude, Sabbath, silence, practicing God's presence, and simplicity) work together to create space for experiencing God's love and companionship?**

#### Personal Summary

This episode presents a refreshing approach to spiritual formation that moves beyond checkbox Christianity to authentic relationship-building with God. The central metaphor of the Tabernacle as a space we create for God to fill provides a powerful framework for understanding spiritual practices. Rather than viewing disciplines as religious duties, the hosts present them as opportunities for intimacy with God and community with others.

The practical wisdom shared - particularly about starting small, choosing practices that fit different seasons of life, and understanding that some disciplines should challenge us while others bring life - makes spiritual formation accessible rather than overwhelming. The emphasis on God filling the space we create, rather than us trying to manufacture spiritual experiences, places the focus on God's grace and presence rather than human effort.

The episode's integration of Jewish practices with Christian spirituality enriches our understanding of biblical patterns of worship and prayer. Most importantly, the redefinition of success as developing intimacy with God rather than achieving measurable ministry outcomes provides a healthy foundation for sustainable spiritual growth and authentic community engagement.

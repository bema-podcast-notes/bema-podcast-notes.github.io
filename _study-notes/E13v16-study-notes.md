### BEMA Episode 13: Grappling with God, Part 1 - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 13 - Grappling with God, Part 1 (2017)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 25-31  
**Topic:** An examination of Jacob's early life, character, and God's choice to work through flawed but passionate individuals

This episode begins a deep dive into the life of Jacob, the third patriarch, exploring why God chose to work through such a complex and morally ambiguous figure. The discussion covers Jacob's birth, his acquisition of Esau's birthright and blessing, his time with Laban, and the theological implications of God using imperfect people.

#### Key Takeaways

- God often chooses passionate but flawed individuals over those who appear more qualified but lack commitment
- The Hebrew concept of *bechor* (firstborn) carries both privilege and responsibility in ancient patriarchal culture
- Words carry inherent power in Eastern Hebrew culture, unlike Western views that see words as empty vessels
- Jacob's deceptive methods, while problematic, demonstrate his deep desire for God's promises
- The story reveals that God can "steer a moving target" more easily than motivate the apathetic
- Jacob's encounter with Laban shows him meeting his match in cunning and deception
- Even dysfunctional family dynamics can be part of God's larger redemptive plan

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The *Bechor* (Firstborn) System
In ancient patriarchal culture, the firstborn son held special significance:
- **Inheritance:** Received a double portion of the father's estate (if three sons exist, estate split four ways with *bechor* getting two shares)
- **Responsibility:** Primary carrier of the father's legacy, mission, and values
- **Honor:** Considered a privilege and honor, not merely an obligation
- **Continuity:** Ensured the continuation of family name and covenant promises

##### Eastern vs. Western Views of Words
The episode highlights a crucial cultural difference:
- **Western Perspective:** "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me" - words are empty conduits, with power residing in truth
- **Eastern Hebrew Perspective:** Words carry inherent power (referencing Genesis 1 where God spoke creation into existence)
- **Practical Implication:** Once Isaac's blessing was spoken, it couldn't be retracted - the words were "efficacious" and would accomplish their purpose

##### The Jacob vs. Esau Dynamic
Two contrasting personalities represent different approaches to God's calling:
- **Esau:** The "safe choice" - strong, skilled hunter, plays by rules, appears qualified but lacks passion for spiritual inheritance
- **Jacob:** The "risky choice" - deceptive, manipulative, but possesses burning desire (*chutzpah*) for God's promises
- **Divine Preference:** God chooses passionate imperfection over apathetic competence

##### The Laban Encounters
Jacob's time with Laban (Genesis 29-31) reveals:
- **Mirror Character:** Laban matches Jacob's cunning, showing Jacob his own reflection
- **Divine Justice:** Jacob experiences being deceived after being a deceiver
- **Cultural Tension:** The idolatry in Nahor's family line contrasts with Abraham's monotheism
- **Unreconciled Reconciliation:** Their final covenant reveals deep, unresolved tensions

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Context Examples
- **Birthright Trading:** Esau's casual attitude toward his inheritance would have been shocking in ancient culture, like a modern heir to a family business saying "whatever" about their responsibilities
- **Blessing Ceremony:** Isaac's inability to retract his blessing parallels ancient legal documents - once sealed and witnessed, they carried permanent authority
- **Marriage Customs:** Laban's insistence that older daughters marry first reflects documented ancient Near Eastern practices

##### Modern Applications
- **Leadership Selection:** Organizations often choose passionate but flawed individuals over technically qualified but uncommitted candidates
- **Personal Growth:** People with intense drive, even misdirected, often achieve more transformation than those who are passive
- **Words and Commitment:** Understanding the power of spoken commitments and promises in relationships and agreements

##### Character Development Parallels
- **Joseph's Story:** The episode notes similarities between Jacob and Joseph, including supernatural elements and divination tools
- **Family Dysfunction:** Even Abraham's family line shows patterns of deception and favoritism across generations
- **God's Patience:** The narrative demonstrates God's long-term perspective in developing character through circumstances

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** What specific qualities made Jacob appealing to God despite his obvious character flaws, and how does this challenge conventional ideas about spiritual qualification?

2. **Cultural Context:** How did the ancient Hebrew understanding of word-power differ from modern Western perspectives, and why couldn't Isaac simply retract his blessing once given?

3. **Character Development:** In what ways did Jacob's encounter with Laban serve as divine discipline, and what does this suggest about God's methods of character formation?

4. **Theological Reflection:** What does God's choice of Jacob over Esau reveal about divine values and priorities, particularly regarding passion versus moral correctness?

5. **Application:** How might the principle of God preferring "moving targets" over apathetic individuals apply to modern discipleship and spiritual growth?

#### Personal Summary

This episode challenges comfortable assumptions about spiritual qualification and God's selection criteria. Rather than choosing the obviously righteous Esau, God selects the passionate but flawed Jacob, suggesting that spiritual hunger and drive may be more valuable to God than moral perfection. The study reveals how God can work through broken family dynamics, use even deceptive circumstances for His purposes, and patiently develop character over time.

The cultural insights about Eastern views of word-power and the *bechor* system illuminate why the birthright and blessing carried such weight in the narrative. Jacob's time with Laban serves as both consequence for his deception and preparation for his future role as Israel. Most encouragingly, the episode suggests that those who recognize themselves as "Jacobs" - passionate but flawed - can take hope that God desires to channel their intensity for His kingdom purposes, even while addressing their problematic methods.

The ongoing nature of Jacob's story (this being only Part 1) reminds us that spiritual formation is a process, and that God's patience with our development mirrors His patience with the patriarchs. The episode ultimately presents a God who values authentic spiritual hunger over superficial righteousness, offering hope to all who struggle with imperfection while pursuing divine calling.

# BEMA Episode 101: The Other Side - Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 101 - The Other Side  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Mark 4:35-5:20 (parallel to Matthew's narrative)

This episode explores Jesus's deliberate journey across the Sea of Galilee to the Decapolis region, where he encounters and heals a demon-possessed man. The teaching examines the cultural significance of crossing to "the other side," the symbolic nature of water in Jewish thought, and Jesus's mission to bring the Kingdom of God to outsiders and pagans. The story reveals how one untrained, healed individual sharing his story catalyzed the eventual Christianization of an entire pagan region.

## Key Takeaways

- Jesus intentionally crosses cultural and religious boundaries by traveling to pagan territory in the Decapolis
- The disciples resist going to "the other side" because it violates their religious upbringing and cultural norms
- Large bodies of water represented chaos and the abyss in Jewish thought, not just physical danger
- Jesus deliberately references the story of Jonah by sleeping on a cushion during the storm
- The disciples demonstrate their knowledge of Torah by recognizing Jesus's authority over creation (Psalm 107, Psalm 89)
- The demon-possessed man represents the ultimate outsider - rejected by both Jewish and Greco-Roman society
- Jesus sends the healed man to share his story rather than receive formal theological training
- Personal testimony is powerful enough to transform entire communities, as evidenced by the later Christianization of Hippos
- The Greco-Roman world resists the Kingdom of God because it threatens their economic systems and social structures
- The Bishop of Hippos later helped pen the Nicene Creed, showing the lasting impact of one healed man's testimony

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Geography of Outsiders

The Sea of Galilee served as a dividing line between Jewish religious culture (the "triangle" of Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Chorazin) and pagan culture (the Decapolis on the eastern shore). Later rabbinical tradition stated that even uttering the word "Decapolis" made a person unclean for seven days. Jesus's command to cross to "the other side" would have been deeply uncomfortable for his disciples.

### The Symbolism of Water in Jewish Thought

In Jewish understanding, large bodies of water symbolized chaos dating back to Genesis 1, where the Spirit of God hovered over the waters. While flowing water from springs or rain (maim chaim - "living water") represented life and came from God, large static bodies of water like the Sea of Galilee represented the abyss or underworld. Luke's Gospel explicitly refers to the Sea of Galilee as "the abyss" twice in this account.

### The Jonah Parallel

Jesus sleeping on a cushion during the storm deliberately echoes Jonah's story. Just as Jonah was called to bring God's message to the pagan Ninevites and resisted, Jesus's disciples resist going to the pagans of the Decapolis. The parallel serves as rabbinical teaching - Jesus acts out the text to help his disciples understand their mission to outsiders.

### Textual References and Jewish Learning

When Jesus calms the storm by saying "Quiet, be still" (or "hush"), he uses language directly from the Psalms (Psalm 107:23-32 and Psalm 89:9). The disciples' response - "Who is this? Even the wind and waves obey him" - echoes Psalm 89:5-8's refrain "Who is like the Lord?" This demonstrates that the disciples are not bumbling idiots but well-trained Jewish students who recognize the scriptural references even in moments of crisis.

### The Gerusim - The Cast Out Ones

The manuscript variations (Gerasenes, Gadarenes, Gergesenes) likely all attempt to translate the Hebrew term "Gerusim," meaning "the cast out ones." This references the seven Gentile nations cast out of Canaan in Joshua 3:10. In rabbinical tradition, the Decapolis was known as the land of the Gerusim. The number seven often represents the Gentile nations in Jewish numerology.

### The Political Symbolism of Legion

The demon's name "Legion" carries heavy political weight. The 10th Roman Legion was stationed just north of Susita (Hippos), and their standard was a boar/pig. The story contains layered political commentary: demons named Legion enter pigs (the Roman standard) and are sent into the abyss (the sea). This represents the ultimate defeat of Roman imperial power through the Kingdom of God.

### The Ultimate Outsider

The demon-possessed man represents complete social rejection. He was:
- Rejected by Jewish society (living in Gentile territory)
- Rejected by Greco-Roman society (forced to live in tombs)
- Unable to be controlled or helped (broke chains and irons)
- Living among the dead (tombs)
- Self-destructive (cutting himself with stones)
- Naked and mentally ill

Jesus chose to restore this man who had no place in any social system, demonstrating the radical inclusivity of the Kingdom.

### The Threat of Kingdom Economics

The Greco-Roman townspeople's response reveals an important truth: they ask Jesus to leave after witnessing the miracle. The Kingdom of God threatened their economic security (2,000 pigs represented significant financial loss) and their social structures (the healed man no longer fit in his assigned box). This mirrors modern resistance to the Kingdom - we prefer comfort and economic security over God's transformative work.

### Story Over Training

Jesus refuses to take the healed man as a disciple despite his having no family, job, or community ties - he would have been the perfect candidate. Instead, Jesus sends him with only his personal story. This man received perhaps an hour or two of conversation with Jesus, no theological training, no Bible knowledge, yet his testimony alone was sufficient to begin transforming the Decapolis.

### The Long-Term Impact

When Jesus returns to the Decapolis later in the Gospels, 4,000 people come to meet him. Archaeological evidence shows that Hippos (Susita) eventually became heavily Christianized with seven churches and a cathedral. The Bishop of Hippos was one of the key figures who helped pen the Nicene Creed, one of Christianity's most foundational statements of faith. One healed man's story catalyzed this transformation.

## Examples & Applications

### Modern Resistance to Kingdom Work

Just as the Greco-Roman townspeople asked Jesus to leave because he threatened their economy, modern Christians often resist Kingdom work when it threatens our comfort, economic security, or social systems. We may love studying the Kingdom theologically while practically resisting its implementation because it would disrupt our comfortable lives.

### The Power of Personal Testimony

The healed demoniac had no seminary training, no Bible college degree, no small group experience, no 101 class - only his story of what Jesus did for him. Yet his story was powerful enough to transform an entire pagan region. This reminds us that formal theological training, while valuable, is not a prerequisite for Kingdom mission. Our personal encounter with Jesus and willingness to share it can have profound impact.

### Crossing Cultural Boundaries

Jesus deliberately crossed the cultural and religious boundaries of his day, going to places "respectable" Jews would never go. This challenges modern believers to examine what boundaries we've erected and what "other sides" we resist crossing. Who are the modern equivalents of the Decapolis - the people and places we consider too pagan, too broken, or too far from God?

### Recognizing Biblical Patterns

The disciples demonstrated deep scriptural knowledge by connecting Jesus's actions to Jonah and the Psalms even during a crisis. This shows the value of knowing Scripture deeply enough that we can recognize God's patterns of work in real-time situations.

### The Journey Matters as Much as the Destination

The disciples wanted to turn back after demonstrating they "got the lesson" about Jesus's authority. But Jesus wasn't just teaching a theological point - he was taking them on a mission to actual people. Sometimes we're content with intellectual understanding when God is calling us to uncomfortable obedience.

## Comprehension Questions

1. Why were the disciples reluctant to cross the Sea of Galilee to the Decapolis, and what cultural and religious factors influenced their resistance? How does Jesus's command to go "to the other side" challenge their understanding of their mission?

2. Explain the significance of Jesus sleeping on a cushion during the storm. What Old Testament story does this reference, and what message is Jesus communicating to his disciples through this action?

3. How do the disciples demonstrate their knowledge of Scripture in their response to Jesus calming the storm? What specific Psalms are they referencing, and what does this reveal about their level of training?

4. Describe the multiple layers of political and spiritual symbolism in the demon being named "Legion" and being sent into pigs. What would this imagery have communicated to both Jewish and Gentile audiences?

5. Why does Jesus refuse to take the healed demoniac as a disciple, and what does this teach about the requirements for Kingdom mission? How did this man's testimony ultimately impact the Decapolis region, and what does this reveal about the power of personal story versus formal theological training?

## Personal Summary

This episode reveals Jesus's intentional mission to break through religious and cultural boundaries by traveling to pagan territory. The journey to "the other side" represents far more than a simple boat trip - it symbolizes crossing into chaos, confronting the abyss, and bringing the Kingdom of God to the ultimate outsiders. The disciples' resistance mirrors Jonah's reluctance to minister to pagans, but Jesus persists in expanding their understanding of God's inclusive love.

The demon-possessed man represents complete social rejection by both Jewish and Greco-Roman societies. Yet Jesus restores him fully and commissions him with only his personal story - no theological training required. This untrained man's simple testimony catalyzed the transformation of the entire Decapolis region, eventually leading to the Christianization of Hippos and the penning of the Nicene Creed by the Bishop of Hippos.

The story challenges us to examine our own resistance to Kingdom work when it threatens our comfort, economic security, or social structures. Like the Greco-Roman townspeople who asked Jesus to leave, we often prefer maintaining our systems over embracing God's transformative power. Yet like the healed demoniac, we're called to cross boundaries, share our stories, and trust that God can use even our limited understanding to bring his Kingdom to the most unlikely places.

# BEMA Episode 31: Remember Where You Came From - Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary
This episode concludes Session 1's study of Torah by examining the book of Deuteronomy, with particular focus on its central themes of remembering one's story and caring for marginalized people. The hosts explore how Deuteronomy functions as Moses's final teaching, emphasizing the Hebrew concepts of "zakar" (remember) and "shakach" (forget), and how these connect to caring for foreigners, orphans, and widows.

## Key Takeaways
- The book of Deuteronomy contains 14 references to "zakar" (remember) and 9 references to not forgetting ("shakach"), emphasizing the critical importance of remembering one's story
- The recurring phrase "Remember that you were slaves in Egypt" serves as the foundation for how God's people should treat marginalized groups
- Caring for foreigners, orphans, and widows is not optional charity but a fundamental requirement based on remembering one's own experience of marginalization
- When we remember our own past vulnerability, we naturally notice and care for those who are currently vulnerable
- Moses's epitaph emphasizes his intimate relationship with God ("face to face") rather than his failure to enter the Promised Land
- Deuteronomy follows the structure of ancient suzerain-vassal covenants, making it familiar to its original audience
- Remembering is an active spiritual discipline, not a passive mental activity

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Structure of Torah as Covenant
Deuteronomy follows the five-part structure of ancient suzerain-vassal covenants:
1. **Preamble** (Deuteronomy 1a) - Introductory setup
2. **Historical Summary** (Deuteronomy 1b-4) - The story of how the relationship began
3. **Stipulations** (Deuteronomy 5-26) - Laws and demands
4. **Rewards and Punishments** (Deuteronomy 28) - Consequences for obedience/disobedience
5. **Conclusion** (Deuteronomy 32) - The Song of Moses for memorization

This structure would have been familiar to ancient audiences and demonstrates God's accommodation to their cultural understanding while subverting typical power dynamics by placing God, not a human ruler, as the suzerain.

### The Hebrew Concept of Remembering (Zakar)
The Hebrew word "zakar" appears 14 times in Deuteronomy and carries deeper meaning than simple mental recall. It involves:
- Active engagement with one's story and identity
- Communal storytelling and intergenerational transmission
- Connection between past experience and present behavior
- Recognition that remembering shapes how we see and treat others

### The Foreigner-Orphan-Widow Triad
This recurring grouping represents the most vulnerable in ancient society:
- **Foreigners** had no tribal protection or land rights
- **Orphans** lacked family support systems
- **Widows** had no economic security in a patriarchal society

These groups serve as a test of whether a community operates by Empire (pushing the vulnerable to margins) or Shalom (bringing the vulnerable to the center).

### Empire vs. Shalom Paradigm
The episode references this ongoing biblical theme:
- **Empire** marginalizes the weak and vulnerable for efficiency and power
- **Shalom** centers the vulnerable and builds community around their needs
- God's people are called to reject Empire patterns and embrace Shalom living

## Examples & Applications

### Ancient Social Safety Net
Deuteronomy describes practical systems for caring for the vulnerable:
- **Gleaning laws** - Leaving portions of harvest for the poor
- **Third-year tithe** - Community collection and redistribution
- **Festival inclusion** - Marginalized groups invited to celebrations
- **Levirate marriage** - System to protect widows from destitution
- **Justice requirements** - Legal protection for the vulnerable

### Modern Application of Remembering
The principle applies beyond ancient Israel:
- Nations built by immigrants forgetting their immigrant story
- Individuals who experienced poverty forgetting to help the poor
- Communities that received help in crisis times forgetting to help others in crisis
- Churches that were once marginalized forgetting to welcome the marginalized

### Moses's Death as Success Redefinition
Rather than seeing Moses's exclusion from the Promised Land as failure, the text emphasizes:
- His unique intimacy with God ("face to face")
- His death "by the mouth of the Lord" (potentially meaning a divine kiss)
- His unparalleled role in Israel's story
- The idea that success is measured by relationship with God, not achievement of goals

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration
- Comparative study of ancient Near Eastern covenant structures and their influence on biblical literature
- The role of communal memory in shaping group identity and ethics
- Examination of other biblical books that emphasize remembering (Psalms, prophetic literature)
- Modern applications of gleaning laws and social safety nets in contemporary contexts
- The theology of divine accommodation in Scripture (God working within human cultural frameworks)
- The concept of "face to face" relationship with God throughout Scripture
- How the Empire vs. Shalom paradigm appears in New Testament writings
- The role of festivals and celebrations in maintaining cultural memory
- Biblical principles for immigration and refugee care
- The connection between personal spiritual formation and social justice

## Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** How does the structure of Deuteronomy as a suzerain-vassal covenant both accommodate and subvert ancient Near Eastern political expectations?

2. **Application:** In what specific ways might modern communities implement the principle "remember that you were slaves in Egypt" when addressing contemporary social issues?

3. **Synthesis:** How do the concepts of "zakar" (remember) and "shakach" (forget) work together to create both individual spiritual formation and community social responsibility?

4. **Evaluation:** Why might the text emphasize Moses's intimate relationship with God rather than his achievement of entering the Promised Land, and what does this suggest about biblical definitions of success?

5. **Reflection:** How does the recurring connection between remembering one's own vulnerability and caring for currently vulnerable people challenge or support your understanding of social responsibility?

## Brief Personalized Summary

This episode powerfully demonstrates how personal spiritual formation and social justice are inseparably connected in biblical thinking. The constant call to "remember that you were slaves in Egypt" isn't just about historical awareness—it's about maintaining the kind of heart that notices and cares for those who are currently in vulnerable positions. The text suggests that when we forget our own stories of rescue, redemption, and divine care, we naturally begin to ignore those who need rescue, redemption, and care today.

What strikes me most is how remembering is presented as an active spiritual discipline rather than passive nostalgia. It requires intentional storytelling, community engagement, and practical systems that center the vulnerable rather than marginalize them. The episode challenges the modern tendency to separate personal piety from social responsibility, showing how biblical faith necessarily involves both intimate relationship with God and concrete care for others. The image of Moses dying by "the mouth of the Lord" while having lived "face to face" with God provides a beautiful picture of what ultimate success looks like—not the achievement of personal goals, but the depth of divine relationship that transforms how we live and love.

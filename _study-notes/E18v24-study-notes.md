### BEMA Episode 18: A Tale of Two Kingdoms - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary
**Episode Title:** A Tale of Two Kingdoms  
**Episode Code:** E18v24  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Guest:** Josh Boss√©  

This foundational episode explores the contrast between empire and shalom as competing narratives throughout biblical history, using Egypt as both historical reality and metaphor for imperial systems that oppose God's kingdom.

#### Key Takeaways

- There are always two competing narratives in the world: empire (based on fear and self-preservation) versus shalom (based on trust and service to others)
- Egypt serves as both historical context and a powerful metaphor for imperial systems throughout biblical narrative
- The Egyptian creation story parallels but fundamentally opposes the Genesis creation account
- God's deliverance from Egypt is not just about physical liberation but about extracting imperial mindset from His people's hearts
- The ten plagues represent a systematic dismantling of Egyptian gods and the imperial narrative they represent
- Moses embodies God's heart for the oppressed and serves as God's representative against Pharaoh's imperial power
- The choice between kingdoms requires active faith and cannot be passive - we cannot serve both narratives

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Two Creation Narratives
The Genesis creation account stands in direct contrast to Egyptian creation mythology:

**Biblical Narrative:**
- God speaks order out of chaos for the benefit of creation
- Humans are made in God's image with inherent dignity
- Creation is declared "tov" (good) and "tov meod" (very good)
- Order serves to bless and sustain all creation

**Egyptian Narrative:**
- Ra (sun god) emerges from chaotic waters, often depicted on a pyramid
- Humanity is an afterthought, created from tears of joy as Ra sees his divine children
- Humans exist to serve and uphold the gods, not for their own flourishing
- The cartouche (rectangular vault) represents the world, held open by Pharaoh to prevent cosmic collapse

##### The Cartouche and Pharaoh's Role
In Egyptian hieroglyphics, Pharaoh's name appears within a cartouche, symbolizing that:
- Pharaoh holds the world together through his divine authority
- Without Pharaoh maintaining order, chaos (waters above and below) would flood the earth
- Citizens must support Pharaoh to maintain cosmic stability
- Only Pharaoh bears divine image - common people are expendable

##### Empire vs. Shalom Framework
**Empire Characteristics:**
- Built on fear and self-preservation
- "Life is cheap and sacrifice of others is acceptable to sustain your own obsession with pleasure and entertainment and wealth"
- Power maintained through coercion (symbolized by Pharaoh's stick/staff)
- Hierarchical structure with divine authority concentrated at the top
- Progress justified at the expense of human cost

**Shalom Characteristics:**
- Built on trust and service to others
- Invites partnership with God in caring for creation
- Power shared and used to lift up the oppressed
- Recognizes inherent dignity of all people made in God's image
- Progress measured by flourishing of the vulnerable

##### The Goshen Paradox
Goshen represents the seductive nature of empire:
- The richest farmland on earth (100 feet of topsoil in Nile delta)
- Provided abundance and security for Joseph's family
- Eventually became a trap as generations bought into Egyptian narrative
- Illustrates how empire can provide material comfort while enslaving the soul

##### The Metal Technology and Imperial Power
Egypt's dominance came through superior metallurgy:
- Controlled world through advanced tools and weapons
- Used slave labor (jumping on bellows) to create oxygen-enriched smelting
- Life expectancy for smelting slaves was extremely short
- Israelites benefited from these tools while slaves died making them
- Demonstrates how empire creates complicity even among the oppressed

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Imperial Narratives
- Political systems built on fear of "the other" rather than trust in God's provision
- Economic systems that prioritize efficiency and profit over human dignity
- Cultural narratives that justify sacrifice of vulnerable populations for "greater good"
- Individual lifestyle choices that depend on exploitation of others

##### The Challenge of Extraction
The question shifts from "How does God get His people out of Egypt?" to "How does God get Egypt out of His people?" This reflects:
- How deeply imperial mindsets embed in our thinking
- Why dramatic intervention is sometimes necessary to break free from comfortable oppression
- The ongoing struggle to choose trust over fear in daily decisions

##### Moses as God's Representative
Moses embodies both God's heart and methods:
- Sees oppression and acts (like God hearing the cry of the oppressed)
- Initially uses violence but learns God's methods in the desert
- Becomes "like God to Pharaoh" - representing divine authority
- Carries staff representing God's power rather than imperial coercion

##### The Plague Narrative as Systematic Deconstruction
The ten plagues systematically dismantle Egyptian gods:
- Each plague targets specific Egyptian deities
- Demonstrates YHWH's superiority over imperial religious system
- Creates experiential knowledge (yada) for Hebrews, Egyptians, and Pharaoh
- Culminates in Passover - requiring active choice to reject Egyptian narrative

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Comparative study of other ancient Near Eastern creation myths and their political implications
- Analysis of how imperial narratives manifest in contemporary religious and political contexts
- Investigation of biblical passages that reference "gods of Egypt" and ongoing spiritual bondage
- Study of metallurgy and technology's role in ancient imperial expansion
- Examination of Joseph's role in Egyptian administrative system and complicity with empire
- Research into archaeological evidence for Hebrew presence in Egypt and forced labor
- Exploration of rabbinic interpretations of Moses's killing of the Egyptian taskmaster
- Analysis of staff/rod symbolism throughout biblical narrative
- Investigation of Passover symbolism and its anti-imperial implications
- Study of mixed multitude who left Egypt with Israelites

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Contrast and Analysis:** How do the biblical and Egyptian creation narratives reflect their respective views on human dignity and purpose? What are the practical implications of each worldview?

2. **Metaphorical Understanding:** In what ways does Egypt function as both a historical location and a symbol throughout biblical narrative? How might "Egypt" manifest in contemporary contexts?

3. **Psychological Liberation:** Why was it necessary for God to make the Israelites' situation worse before delivering them? What does this teach about the nature of spiritual and psychological liberation?

4. **Power and Authority:** Compare and contrast the symbolism of Pharaoh's staff versus Moses's staff. What do they represent about different approaches to authority and power?

5. **Choice and Commitment:** Why did God require the Israelites to actively participate in the Passover ritual rather than simply delivering them without their involvement? How does this relate to the ongoing choice between empire and shalom?

#### Personal Reflection Summary

This episode presents a foundational framework for understanding the entire biblical narrative as a contest between two incompatible worldviews. The Egyptian empire represents systems built on fear, exploitation, and self-preservation, while God's kingdom operates on trust, service, and mutual flourishing. The physical exodus from Egypt becomes a powerful metaphor for the ongoing spiritual challenge of extracting imperial thinking from our hearts and minds.

The discussion reveals how seductive empire can be - offering comfort, security, and material abundance while slowly enslaving our souls. The Israelites' reluctance to leave Goshen reflects our own difficulty in abandoning systems that benefit us materially but compromise us spiritually. The systematic dismantling of Egyptian gods through the plagues demonstrates God's commitment not just to political liberation but to cognitive and spiritual transformation.

Perhaps most challenging is the recognition that we cannot serve both narratives simultaneously. The choice between empire and shalom requires active faith, ongoing vigilance, and community support. This "tale of two kingdoms" continues to play out in every generation, demanding that we regularly examine which story we are living and whose interests we are truly serving.

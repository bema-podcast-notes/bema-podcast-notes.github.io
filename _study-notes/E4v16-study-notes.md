### BEMA Episode 4: His Bow in the Clouds - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 4: His Bow in the Clouds (E4v16)  
**Hosts:** Brent Billings, Marty Solomon, with guest Kevin Luo  
**Focus:** Genesis 6:1 - Genesis 9:17 (Noah and the Flood)

This episode explores the story of Noah and the flood through an Eastern lens, examining how the biblical account compares to ancient flood narratives like the Epic of Gilgamesh and Sumerian flood stories. The discussion reveals how the author of Genesis retells familiar cultural stories to reveal the true character of God as fundamentally different from the gods of surrounding cultures.

#### Key Takeaways

- The flood narrative contains intentional "problems" that invite deeper exploration and understanding
- Ancient flood stories were common across cultures (Babylonian, Mesopotamian, Sumerian, Egyptian), often predating Genesis
- The Genesis account reframes familiar stories to reveal God's true character as loving and covenant-keeping
- The story follows a chiastic structure with specific numerical patterns (7-7-40-150-150-40-7-7)
- The narrative parallels creation in Genesis 1, suggesting themes of recreation and renewal
- God's "bow in the clouds" represents a weapon turned away from earth, symbolizing divine restraint
- The covenant emphasis (mentioned 7 times) shows God taking responsibility for remembering rather than placing burden on humanity
- Unlike other flood stories where heroes outsmart angry gods, God partners with Noah to save creation

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Literary Structure and Chiasm

The flood narrative exhibits a sophisticated chiastic structure centered on Genesis 8:1: "But God remembered Noah." The numerical pattern (7-7-40-150-150-40-7-7) creates symmetry that emphasizes the central theme of God's remembrance and faithfulness.

##### Comparative Literature Analysis

The story must be understood against the backdrop of ancient Near Eastern flood narratives:

- **Epic of Gilgamesh**: Features Utnapishtim who outsmarts angry gods to save creation
- **Sumerian flood stories**: Contain identical character names (Noa, Japhet, Shem, Ham)
- **Mesopotamian traditions**: Familiar to Abraham and his descendants from Ur of the Chaldeans

##### Recreation Themes

The flood narrative mirrors Genesis 1 creation sequence:
- Spirit (ruach) hovering over waters
- Light entering through the ark window (separation of light/darkness)
- Waters above and below separated
- Dry ground appearing
- Birds in the sky
- Animals on dry ground
- Humans emerging last

##### Covenant Theology

The post-flood covenant demonstrates revolutionary covenant concepts:
- **Suzerain-Vassal covenant reversal**: Typically, the vassal (weaker party) must remember and produce covenant signs
- **Divine responsibility**: God takes on both roles, keeping the covenant sign in the clouds
- **Unconditional commitment**: "Even though every inclination of the human heart is evil, I will not destroy the earth"

##### Symbolism of the Bow

The Hebrew word for rainbow is simply "bow" (weapon), pointing upward away from earth, symbolizing:
- God's weapon turned toward himself rather than creation
- Divine self-restraint and commitment to preservation
- Visual reminder of God's covenant faithfulness

#### Examples & Applications

##### Cultural Context Applications

Understanding how the Genesis author reframes familiar stories helps modern readers:
- Recognize when Scripture engages with contemporary cultural narratives
- Apply similar hermeneutical approaches to modern cultural stories
- Appreciate the subversive nature of biblical theology

##### Covenant Understanding

The flood covenant provides a template for understanding divine-human relationships:
- God initiates and maintains relationship
- Divine faithfulness doesn't depend on human performance
- Signs and reminders serve God's remembrance, not human obligation

##### Problem-Solving Approach

The episode demonstrates productive engagement with biblical "problems":
- Apparent contradictions invite deeper study rather than dismissal
- Cultural and historical context illuminates meaning
- Literary structure reveals authorial intent

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Detailed analysis of ancient flood narratives and their theological implications
- Investigation of other biblical stories that engage with ancient Near Eastern literature
- Study of how various cultures preserved flood memories

##### Covenant Theology Development
- Trace covenant concepts from Noah through Abraham, Moses, and David
- Examine how New Testament writers understood Noahic covenant
- Explore implications for contemporary Christian understanding of divine-human relationship

##### Creation and Recreation Themes
- Connect flood narrative to other biblical recreation passages
- Examine parallels between Noah and second Adam typology
- Study ecological and environmental implications of the flood covenant

##### Literary Analysis Techniques
- Master chiastic structure identification in other biblical narratives
- Develop skills in recognizing numerical patterns and their significance
- Practice comparative literature analysis with biblical texts

##### Historical and Archaeological Context
- Research ancient flood evidence and cultural memory preservation
- Study Mesopotamian literature and its relationship to biblical texts
- Investigate the historical background of Abraham's cultural context

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Literary Structure**: How does the chiastic structure of the flood narrative with its center at "God remembered Noah" change your understanding of the story's meaning? What does it suggest about God's character that remembrance is central?

2. **Comparative Analysis**: In what ways does the Genesis flood account subvert expectations established by other ancient flood narratives like the Epic of Gilgamesh? What does this reveal about the author's theological agenda?

3. **Creation Parallels**: Explain how the flood narrative mirrors the creation sequence in Genesis 1. What theological significance might the author intend by structuring the story as a "recreation" rather than mere destruction?

4. **Covenant Innovation**: How does God's decision to keep the covenant sign (rainbow/bow) in the clouds rather than requiring Noah to maintain it represent a revolutionary approach to ancient covenant-making? What are the implications for divine-human relationships?

5. **Problem Identification**: The episode emphasizes learning to notice "problems" in biblical texts as gateways to deeper understanding. Identify one "problem" from the flood narrative not discussed in the episode and explain how it might lead to further insight.

#### Personal Summary

The flood narrative emerges as far more than a simple moral tale about divine judgment and human obedience. Instead, it represents a sophisticated theological treatise that engages with familiar cultural stories to reveal revolutionary truths about God's character. The author of Genesis takes well-known flood traditions from Abraham's Mesopotamian background and transforms them to show that the true God is not an angry, capricious deity requiring appeasement, but a covenant-keeping creator who partners with humanity for creation's restoration.

The story's chiastic structure, numerical patterns, and recreation themes all point toward a God who knows both when to stop creating and when to stop destroying - demonstrating divine wisdom and self-restraint. Most remarkably, this God reverses typical covenant expectations by taking responsibility for remembrance and sign-keeping, offering unconditional commitment even while acknowledging continued human moral failure.

This approach to reading Scripture - embracing problems as invitations to deeper understanding and utilizing historical-cultural context for interpretation - provides a model for engaging biblical texts that honors both their ancient context and contemporary relevance. The flood story ultimately reveals a God who is fundamentally "for" creation and humanity, committed to restoration rather than destruction, partnership rather than domination.

### BEMA Episode 15: Into the Pit - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 15 - Into the Pit (2017)  
**Scripture:** Genesis 37-40  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon & Brent Billings  
**Focus:** The beginning of Joseph's story, examining his character flaws and the dysfunctional family dynamics that shaped the narrative of God's chosen family.

#### Key Takeaways

- Joseph appears arrogant and narcissistic rather than the traditional hero figure often portrayed in Sunday school stories
- The ornate robe represents Jacob's declaration of Joseph as his chosen heir (bechor), creating intense family hatred
- Joseph's dreams reveal his self-centered worldview and lack of wisdom in handling family relationships
- The story parallels earlier deception patterns in the family line through the Hebrew word "nakar" (recognize)
- Genesis 38 (Judah and Tamar) is deliberately placed to contrast with Joseph's story and show consequences of earlier actions
- God continues to work through flawed people despite their moral failures and character defects
- The family of God appears to be losing the plot of their mission to bless all nations

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Bechor (Firstborn) Principle
- The **bechor** receives a double portion of both responsibility and inheritance
- Jacob giving Joseph a second coat publicly declares him as the chosen heir
- This bypasses the natural birth order and creates family conflict
- Every son would have had a basic coat; the second coat was the significant statement

##### The Pattern of Deception (Nakar)
- **Nakar** (Hebrew: recognize/examine) appears 8 times in Genesis
- First two uses: Jacob deceiving others (Isaac and Laban)
- Next two uses: Jacob being deceived by his sons (Joseph's coat)
- Following two uses: Judah being deceived by Tamar
- The pattern shows deception being passed down through generations

##### Literary Structure and Parallel Stories
- Genesis 38 (Judah and Tamar) interrupts the Joseph narrative deliberately
- Both stories involve deception, recognition, and consequences
- The author juxtaposes stories to highlight themes of justice and moral failure
- Clothing items serve as evidence in both stories (Joseph's robe, Judah's seal and staff)

##### Joseph's Character Analysis
- **At age 17:** Brings bad reports about his brothers, shares arrogant dreams
- **With Potiphar:** His moral reasoning focuses on his own status and privileges
- **In prison:** Interprets dreams primarily to benefit himself
- Consistently displays self-absorption rather than selfless heroism

##### God's Mysterious Grace
- God blesses Joseph despite his character flaws
- Similar pattern seen with Jacob, Samson, and other flawed biblical figures
- Raises questions about what God sees in this family that others might miss
- Suggests God works through people's passion and "chutzpah" rather than perfection

#### Examples & Applications

##### Real-World Family Dynamics
- Favoritism in families creates lasting resentment and division
- Public displays of preference can destroy sibling relationships
- Young people often lack wisdom in handling sensitive situations
- Past family traumas and patterns tend to repeat across generations

##### Leadership and Character Development
- Early success can mask underlying character defects
- True leadership requires considering others' perspectives and feelings
- Moral reasoning that focuses primarily on self-interest reveals immaturity
- Growth often comes through difficult circumstances rather than comfort

##### Divine Grace and Human Failure
- God often works through imperfect people to accomplish His purposes
- Past failures don't disqualify someone from future usefulness
- Sometimes consequences must be experienced before transformation occurs
- God's timeline for character development may span generations

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Midrash and Jewish Commentary:** Traditional Jewish interpretations of Joseph's character and the family dynamics
- **Ancient Near Eastern Culture:** Understanding shepherding practices, inheritance laws, and prostitution in biblical times
- **Theological Questions:** How God's sovereignty works alongside human free will and moral failure
- **Literary Analysis:** Comparative study of parallel narratives and recurring themes throughout Genesis
- **Archaeological Context:** Historical background of Egypt during the Middle Kingdom period
- **Psychological Perspectives:** Family systems theory applied to biblical narratives
- **Hebrew Language Study:** Deeper exploration of key terms like nakar, bechor, and their cultural significance

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Character Analysis:** What specific evidence does the transcript provide that challenges the traditional "heroic Joseph" narrative, and how might this change our understanding of the story's message?

2. **Cultural Context:** How does understanding the bechor (firstborn) system help explain the brothers' violent reaction to Joseph's second coat, and what does this reveal about ancient inheritance practices?

3. **Literary Structure:** Why do you think the author of Genesis deliberately interrupts the Joseph story with the Judah and Tamar narrative in chapter 38, and what themes connect these two stories?

4. **Pattern Recognition:** Trace the use of the Hebrew word "nakar" (recognize) through the episodes mentioned. What does this pattern of deception reveal about the family's spiritual condition?

5. **Theological Reflection:** Given Joseph's apparent character flaws and the family's dysfunction, why might God continue to work through this particular family line, and what does this suggest about divine grace?

#### Brief Personal Summary

Episode 15 challenges comfortable assumptions about Joseph as a flawless hero, instead presenting him as an arrogant, self-centered young man whose actions contribute to family dysfunction. The episode reveals how Jacob's favoritism, demonstrated through the gift of a second coat, publicly declared Joseph as his chosen heir and triggered murderous hatred among the brothers. 

The story becomes more complex when Genesis 38 interrupts the narrative to tell Judah's story with Tamar, creating a deliberate parallel that highlights themes of recognition and deception. Both stories feature clothing as evidence and use the Hebrew word "nakar" (recognize) at crucial moments, suggesting a pattern of deception passed down through generations.

Perhaps most significantly, the episode grapples with the troubling question of why God continues to bless and work through such flawed individuals. Rather than offering easy answers, it suggests that God may be drawn to passion and "chutzpah" rather than perfection, and that His purposes often unfold through broken people and dysfunctional circumstances. This sets up the ongoing question of whether this family can ever fulfill their calling to bless all nations, or if they have permanently lost the plot of their divine mission.

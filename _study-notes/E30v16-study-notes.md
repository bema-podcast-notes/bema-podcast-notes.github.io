### BEMA Episode 30: Lead with Your Voice - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary
This episode examines the story of Moses striking the rock in Numbers 20 and explores why Moses was denied entry to the Promised Land. The discussion analyzes two competing narratives throughout scripture: empire (using force/stick) versus shalom (using voice/invitation), and how Moses's leadership journey demonstrates the tension between these approaches.

#### Key Takeaways
- There are two dominant narratives competing throughout human history: empire (force, fear, self-preservation) versus shalom (invitation, trust, self-sacrifice)
- Moses was raised in Pharaoh's household (empire narrative) but shaped by God in the desert to lead as a shepherd (shalom narrative)
- The traditional explanations for Moses's punishment (hitting rock twice, not following instructions, taking credit) are inadequate when examined closely
- Moses's failure was not mechanical disobedience but a reversion to empire leadership methods when he should have demonstrated God's holiness through voice
- The story in Numbers 20 is deliberately linked to Exodus 17 through specific Hebrew phrases and narrative parallels
- God wants leaders who demonstrate His character of love, grace, and difference through invitation rather than coercion

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Two Narratives Framework
- **Empire Narrative**: Characterized by force ("stick"), fear, self-preservation, comfort, security, and coercion
- **Shalom Narrative**: Characterized by invitation ("voice"), trust, self-sacrifice, and demonstrating God's holiness
- These narratives compete both internally (in our hearts) and externally (in the world around us)

##### Moses's Leadership Journey
- **Phase 1 (Age 0-40)**: Raised in Pharaoh's household, learned empire methods but retained God's heart for the oppressed
- **Phase 2 (Age 40-80)**: Shaped as shepherd in desert, learning God's narrative and methods
- **Phase 3 (Age 80-120)**: Leading Israel, ongoing lessons in using God's authority versus Pharaoh's methods

##### The Hebrew Concept of Nakah
- Means "to strike to kill" or "to smite"
- Used throughout Moses's journey to teach lessons about authority
- In Exodus 17, God told Moses to "nakah" the rock (strike God metaphorically)
- In Numbers 20, Moses used "nakah" twice, possibly killing people in his anger

##### The Paniym Principle
- Hebrew word meaning God positioned "in front of" or "between"
- In Exodus 17, God stood between Moses and the rock, taking the blow for the people
- In Numbers 20, Moses positioned people between himself and the rock, reversing the lesson

#### Examples & Applications

##### Biblical Parallels
- **Balaam's Donkey**: Immediately following this story, God opens a donkey's mouth to use voice when humans won't
- **Jesus's Triumphal Entry**: "If these people don't cry out, the very stones will cry out" - God's commitment to voice
- **Paul's Teaching**: 1 Corinthians 10 references the midrash about the rock following Israel through the desert

##### Leadership Applications
- Employers, teachers, parents, and others in authority positions face the choice between empire and shalom methods
- Using authority tells either the narrative of empire or the narrative of Kingdom/Shalom
- True leadership demonstrates God's character of love and grace rather than relying on force or position

##### Historical Context
- **Desert Tests**: Three tests on the way to Sinai (heart/will, soul/essence, external enemies) parallel the tests in Numbers
- **Midrashic Tradition**: Miriam's role in providing water through speaking to the rock demonstrates the power of voice
- **Place Names**: Locations receiving multiple names (Kadesh/Meribah, Rephidim/Massah) indicate layered significance

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration
- The role of anger and accumulated frustration in leadership failures
- Comparative study of empire versus kingdom leadership models throughout scripture
- The significance of Miriam's death and its connection to the water crisis
- Hebrew word studies on nakah, paniym, and marah (bitter/rebellious)
- The midrashic tradition regarding the portable rock and its theological implications
- Joshua's leadership model as contrasted with Moses's later failures
- The concept of demonstrating God's holiness in practical leadership situations
- Connection between voice/speech and God's creative power in Genesis
- The role of grief and loss in leadership decision-making
- Analysis of God's patience versus justice in dealing with repeated rebellion

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Comparative Analysis**: How do the two narratives of empire and shalom manifest in modern leadership contexts, and what specific behaviors characterize each approach?

2. **Textual Connection**: What specific Hebrew phrases and narrative elements link the Numbers 20 incident to Exodus 17, and why is this connection crucial to understanding Moses's failure?

3. **Character Development**: How did Moses's upbringing in Pharaoh's household versus his 40 years as a shepherd in the desert shape his leadership style, and where do we see evidence of both influences throughout his ministry?

4. **Theological Significance**: What does it mean for God to be "demonstrated as holy" through human leadership, and how does this concept relate to the broader biblical understanding of holiness?

5. **Leadership Transition**: Why was it necessary for Joshua rather than Moses to lead Israel into the Promised Land, and what does this teach us about the consequences of reverting to old patterns of leadership?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This episode reveals that Moses's exclusion from the Promised Land wasn't about minor disobedience but about a fundamental leadership failure. After 120 years of learning to lead with God's voice rather than Pharaoh's stick, Moses reverted to empire methods in a moment of frustration and grief. God's judgment wasn't petty but protective - He couldn't allow the Promised Land to be established through the narrative of force and fear. The story challenges modern leaders to examine whether they lead through coercion or invitation, demonstrating either the character of worldly power or the holiness of God's love and grace. It's a sobering reminder that even great leaders can fall back into old patterns, and that our methods of leadership matter as much as our intentions.

# BEMA Episode 31: Remember Where You Came From - Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary
This episode focuses on the book of Deuteronomy as Moses' final teaching to Israel before entering the Promised Land. Marty Solomon and Brent Billings explore the central theme of remembering one's origins and how this memory shapes treatment of marginalized people - specifically the alien, orphan, and widow.

## Key Takeaways

- Moses had an incredibly intimate relationship with God, described as knowing God "face to face" - a Hebrew expression that implies the intimacy of a kiss between lovers
- Deuteronomy contains 23 references to "remember" (zakar) and "do not forget" (shakach), emphasizing the critical importance of remembering one's story
- The phrase "remember you were slaves in Egypt" appears repeatedly as justification for treating marginalized people with compassion
- When we forget where we came from, we stop caring for those who are currently in positions we once occupied
- America, as a nation of immigrants, has lessons to learn from Israel's call to remember their immigrant/slave origins
- Deuteronomy follows the structure of ancient Suzerain-vassal covenants, showing it was written as a formal covenant document
- The entire Torah (Five Books of Moses) can be viewed as one complete covenant structure

## Main Concepts & Theories

**The Hebrew Expression "Face to Face" (panim el panim)**
Moses' relationship with God is described using language typically reserved for intimate marital relationships. The Hebrew expression suggests physical closeness similar to lovers kissing, indicating an unprecedented level of intimacy between Moses and the Creator.

**The Cycle of Remembrance and Care**
Deuteronomy establishes a spiritual cycle: when we remember where we came from, we notice the marginalized (alien, orphan, widow). When we care for the marginalized, we are reminded of our own origins. This creates a positive feedback loop that keeps believers connected to both their past and their mission.

**Ancient Covenant Structure**
Deuteronomy follows the five-part structure of ancient Near Eastern covenants:
1. Preamble (Chapter 1A)
2. Historical Summary (Chapters 1-4)
3. Laws/Demands (Chapters 5-26)
4. Rewards/Punishments (Chapter 28)
5. Conclusion/Song (Chapter 32)

**The Marginalized Trinity: Alien, Orphan, Widow**
These three groups represent people pushed to society's edges - those without land rights, family protection, or social standing. They parallel Israel's experience as slaves in Egypt, making care for them a test of whether Israel remembers their story.

## Examples & Applications

**Modern Immigration Parallels**
Just as Israel was commanded to remember their experience as aliens in Egypt, modern nations built by immigrants (like America) should consider how their origins inform their treatment of current immigrants and refugees.

**Harvest Laws as Social Justice**
Deuteronomy's agricultural laws required leaving corners of fields unharvested and not going back for forgotten sheaves. This wasn't charity but justice - a structural system ensuring food security for the vulnerable based on remembering shared humanity.

**Festival Inclusion**
Israel's religious celebrations were required to include foreigners, orphans, and widows. This ensured that moments of national joy weren't exclusive to the economically advantaged but reflected the inclusive character God desired.

**Economic Generosity Systems**
The tithe every third year was specifically designated for Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows - creating a systematic approach to economic justice rather than leaving it to individual charitable impulses.

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Study the specific Hebrew words zakar (remember) and shakach (forget) to understand their full semantic range
- Examine how Jesus' ministry specifically embodied care for modern equivalents of the alien, orphan, and widow
- Research ancient Near Eastern covenant structures to better understand biblical literature
- Investigate the prophetic books (especially Isaiah) to see how they call Israel back to Deuteronomy's themes
- Explore the theological implications of describing God-human relationship in marital/intimate terms
- Study the Song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32) and its role in Jewish liturgical tradition
- Examine how early Christian communities applied these principles in their treatment of marginalized people
- Research Sandra Richter's "Epic of Eden" for deeper understanding of Suzerain-vassal covenants

## Comprehension Questions

1. How does the Hebrew expression for Moses knowing God "face to face" challenge typical Western understanding of divine-human relationships?

2. What is the significance of the repeated phrase "remember you were slaves in Egypt" in relation to specific laws about treating marginalized people?

3. How does the five-part structure of ancient covenants help us understand both Deuteronomy specifically and the Torah as a whole?

4. What modern parallels can you draw between Israel's experience as slaves/aliens in Egypt and contemporary refugee or immigrant experiences?

5. According to this episode, what happens spiritually and socially when a people "forget where they came from," and how might this apply to modern nations or communities?

## Brief Personalized Summary

This episode presents Deuteronomy not just as a legal code but as Moses' passionate final plea for Israel to maintain their identity through active remembrance. The central insight is that memory isn't just about the past - it's about present character and future mission. When we forget our own experiences of vulnerability, marginalization, or rescue, we lose our capacity to recognize and respond to those same conditions in others. The "alien, orphan, and widow" become litmus tests for whether we truly remember our story. This creates a powerful framework for thinking about how personal and national narratives should inform contemporary ethics, particularly around immigration, economic justice, and care for society's most vulnerable members.

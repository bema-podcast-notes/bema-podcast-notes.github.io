### BEMA Episode 27: Images of the Desert â€” Rotem and Acacia

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode explores two significant desert trees that serve as powerful biblical metaphors: the rotem (broom tree) and the acacia tree. Through these desert images, Marty Solomon and Brent Billings examine themes of provision, refuge, and spiritual resilience during life's wilderness seasons. The discussion connects botanical realities of Middle Eastern desert life with theological insights about God's provision and our calling to provide for others.

#### Key Takeaways

- The rotem bush provides minimal but sufficient shade in the desert, representing God's provision of "just enough" in our times of need
- Biblical references to shade carry deeper meaning when understood through Middle Eastern desert context
- God is our ultimate shade and refuge, but He also calls us to be shade for others in their desert seasons
- The acacia tree can appear dead for years but springs to life when water comes, symbolizing spiritual resilience and fruitfulness
- Psalm 1's tree "planted by streams of water" likely refers to the acacia, emphasizing fruitfulness "in season" rather than constant productivity
- The Hebrew word "hagah" (meditate) means to growl like a lion over prey, indicating intense devotion to God's word

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Rotem Bush: Shade in the Desert

The rotem bush (broom tree) serves as the primary biblical image for shade in desert contexts. Key characteristics include:

- **Physical Description**: Small, solitary bushes typically 2-3 feet tall, providing minimal shade for one person
- **Biblical Context**: Associated with moments of distress (Elijah under the rotem bush wanting to die)
- **Theological Significance**: Represents God's provision of "just enough" rather than abundance
- **Practical Application**: We are called to be rotem bush shade for others - not providing all answers but offering presence and support

##### Biblical References to Shade

Multiple scripture passages use shade as metaphor for refuge and protection:
- Judges 9: Thorn bush offering shade as refuge
- Psalm 80: Vine providing extensive shade coverage
- Psalm 121: "The Lord is your shade at your right hand"
- Song of Songs 2: Delighting to sit in beloved's shade
- Isaiah 4, 25, 30: Shade as shelter from heat, refuge for the poor and needy

##### The Dual Nature of Desert Images

God provides shade for us, but also calls us to be shade for others, as seen in Isaiah 32:
- One King reigns in righteousness (Jesus)
- Multiple rulers rule with justice (believers as kingdom of priests)
- Each one called to be "a shelter and shade in the heat of the day"

##### The Acacia Tree: Gift of the Desert

The acacia represents resilience and unexpected fruitfulness:

- **Physical Characteristics**: Grows at the end of wadis where flash flood waters collect and spread
- **Practical Value**: Strong wood for building, burns efficiently, medicinal sap, pods for livestock feed
- **Bedouin Name**: "Gift of the desert" due to its multiple uses
- **Dormancy Cycle**: Can appear dead for up to a decade, then spring to life when water comes

##### Psalm 1 and the Acacia Connection

Biblical botanist Noga Hareuveni identified the Psalm 1 tree as the acacia:
- "Planted by streams of rushing water" connects to wadi flash floods
- "Yields fruit in season" reflects the acacia's unpredictable but reliable fruitfulness
- Emphasizes faithfulness during dormant periods and fruitfulness when the time comes

##### Hagah: The Lion's Meditation

The Hebrew word "hagah" (meditate) carries deeper meaning:
- Onomatopoeic word meaning the low growl of a lion over its prey
- Not passive contemplation but intense, possessive devotion
- Applied to meditation on God's law suggests fierce dedication to divine wisdom

#### Examples & Applications

##### Personal Ministry Application

Marty shares his transformation in approaching grief ministry:
- Previously felt pressure to be an "oak tree of shade" with all answers
- Learned to offer "rotem bush shade" - presence without needing to solve everything
- Applicable to hospital visits, funerals, and supporting those in distress

##### Campus Ministry Examples

The acacia principle applies to ministry work:
- South Bend team worked at Bethel University for years with no visible results
- Sudden "flash flood" brought 50 people to Bible study
- Mitch in Florida waited 2.5 years alone before dozen people joined in two weeks
- Demonstrates patience during dormant seasons and readiness for fruitful seasons

##### Discipleship Applications

- Pursuing: Learning these principles personally
- Modeling: Demonstrating practices to young adults
- Teaching: Sharing insights with college students and others
- Focus on preparing young people for inevitable desert seasons in life

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Desert Imagery Series**: Study other desert images mentioned (shepherds, additional trees)
- **Hebrew Word Studies**: Deeper exploration of "hagah" and other Hebrew concepts
- **Psalm 1 and Jeremiah 17 Comparison**: Examine parallel passages about trees by water
- **Isaiah 32 Kingdom Theology**: Explore the one king/many rulers framework
- **Biblical Botany**: Study Noga Hareuveni's work on biblical plants and trees
- **Middle Eastern Geography**: Learn about wadis, flash floods, and desert ecosystems
- **Practical Discipleship**: Develop methods for pursuing, modeling, and teaching these concepts

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How does understanding the physical reality of the rotem bush change your interpretation of biblical passages about shade?** Consider the difference between American expectations of comfort and the "just enough" provision of desert shade.

2. **What does it mean practically to be "rotem bush shade" for someone in distress, and how does this differ from trying to be an "oak tree of shade"?** Reflect on specific situations where you could apply this principle.

3. **Explain the connection between the acacia tree's growth pattern and the concept of "yielding fruit in season" from Psalm 1.** How does this understanding encourage patience during spiritually dormant periods?

4. **Compare and contrast the Hebrew concept of "hagah" (meditate) with contemporary Western ideas of meditation.** What does it mean to "growl over" God's word like a lion over its prey?

5. **How does the dual nature of desert images (God provides for us, we provide for others) apply to modern Christian life and community?** Give specific examples of this principle in action.

#### Personalized Summary

This episode powerfully reframes our understanding of God's provision and our role in community through two desert trees. The rotem bush teaches us that God's provision often comes as "just enough" rather than abundance, and challenges us to offer presence over solutions when supporting others in distress. The acacia tree provides hope for seasons of spiritual dormancy, reminding us that apparent death can precede unexpected fruitfulness when the right season arrives.

The Hebrew concept of "hagah" transforms our understanding of meditation from passive contemplation to fierce devotion, while the dual nature of these images calls us both to receive God's shade and to become shade for others. These principles have immediate application in discipleship, ministry, and community life, encouraging patience during dormant seasons while maintaining readiness for times of fruitfulness. The desert imagery ultimately points to God's faithfulness in providing exactly what we need, when we need it, while calling us to extend that same provision to others in their wilderness seasons.

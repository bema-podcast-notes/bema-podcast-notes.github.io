### BEMA Episode 16: Out of the Pit - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary
**Episode:** BEMA 16: Out of the Pit (2017)  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 41-50  
**Main Theme:** The conclusion of Joseph's story, emphasizing forgiveness as the ultimate expression of trust in God's story

This episode completes the study of Joseph's life, exploring how his experiences in Egypt parallel his family history and lead to a profound understanding of forgiveness as the foundational characteristic of God's chosen people.

#### Key Takeaways

- Joseph's ability to interpret Pharaoh's dream comes from recognizing parallels to his own family story
- The dream's imagery (beautiful/ugly cows, seven years) directly connects to Jacob's experience with Rachel and Leah
- Joseph demonstrates *chutzpah* - the boldness to not just accept bad news but to create solutions
- The story follows a repeating pattern: gifts → dreams → coat stripped → pit, which is ultimately reversed
- Judah's transformation from Genesis 38 enables the family reconciliation
- Forgiveness represents the ultimate expression of trust in God's story
- The family of God is characterized by justice, forgiveness, and *chesed* (love, compassion, generosity)

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Pattern of Reversal
Joseph's life follows a deliberate narrative pattern that gets reversed:
1. **First Pattern (repeated twice):** Gifts → Dreams → Coat Stripped → Pit
   - With his brothers: Father's favoritism → Joseph's dreams → Brothers strip his coat → Thrown in cistern
   - With Potiphar: Household authority → Potiphar's wife's desires → Coat torn off → Thrown in dungeon

2. **Final Reversal:** Out of Pit → Clothes Put On → Dreams Interpreted → Gifts Received
   - Pharaoh pulls him from dungeon → Joseph changes clothes → Interprets Pharaoh's dreams → Receives authority over Egypt

##### Dream Interpretation Through Personal Experience
Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dream by recognizing elements from his own family history:
- **Beautiful vs. Ugly Cows:** Parallel to Rachel (beautiful) vs. Leah (less favored)
- **Seven Years:** Jacob worked seven years for Rachel, then seven more for being deceived
- **The consuming pattern:** The ugly cows eat the beautiful ones but show no change, representing how famine will completely overshadow abundance

The Hebrew word for "reeds" (*ahu*) shares roots with "brothers," suggesting the cows grazed "among the brothers" - a hint at the dream's personal significance for Joseph.

##### The Transformation of Identity
Joseph faces a critical identity crisis: Is he Egyptian (son of Pharaoh) or Hebrew (son of Jacob)? This tension comes to a head when his brothers appear in Egypt, forcing him to choose between:
- **Vengeance:** Using his power to punish those who wronged him
- **Forgiveness:** Embracing his role in God's family story

##### Jacob vs. Israel
The text deliberately uses both names for Joseph's father:
- **Jacob:** Represents self-interest and protective instincts
- **Israel:** Represents surrender to God's will and plan

##### The Role of Judah
Judah's character development from Genesis 38 (the Tamar incident) equips him to be the catalyst for family reconciliation:
- Learned the meaning of righteousness and justice
- Offers his own life as collateral for Benjamin (not just his sons like Reuben offered)
- His willingness to sacrifice himself mirrors the pattern that will define God's people

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Pattern
The Joseph narrative establishes a template that repeats throughout Hebrew scripture:
- **David and Jonathan:** Benjamin (Jonathan's tribe) saves Judah (David's tribe)
- **Book of Esther:** Same dynamic of mutual sacrifice and salvation
- This creates a recurring theme where Judah and Benjamin alternately save each other

##### *Chutzpah* in Action
Joseph exemplifies the boldness that characterizes God's chosen people:
- Doesn't just deliver bad news about the coming famine
- Immediately provides a comprehensive solution
- Takes initiative to prevent catastrophe rather than accepting defeat
- This "stiff-necked" quality that God often criticizes is actually the strength that enables survival

##### Modern Applications
- **Crisis Response:** Like Joseph, believers should respond to challenges with solutions, not just fear
- **Family Reconciliation:** Forgiveness doesn't ignore wrongdoing but chooses restoration over revenge
- **Identity Formation:** Our primary identity should be as members of God's family, not our earthly achievements
- **Trust in Providence:** Even betrayal and suffering can be part of God's larger story

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Comparative Analysis:** How does Joseph's story compare to other biblical figures who faced similar identity crises?
- **Theological Study:** The relationship between divine sovereignty and human free will in the Joseph narrative
- **Literary Analysis:** The sophisticated narrative structure and parallels throughout Genesis
- **Historical Context:** Egyptian customs and political structures during the time of Joseph
- **Psychological Study:** The effects of abandonment and reconciliation on family dynamics
- **Messianic Typology:** How Joseph prefigures later biblical themes of suffering, elevation, and salvation
- ***Chesed* Study:** Deep dive into this Hebrew concept of loyal love and its role in covenant relationships

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **How does Joseph's interpretation of Pharaoh's dream demonstrate the importance of personal experience in understanding God's messages?** Analyze how Joseph's family history with Rachel, Leah, and the seven-year work periods provided the key to understanding the dream's symbolism.

2. **What is the significance of the repeated pattern of gifts → dreams → coat stripped → pit in Joseph's story, and how does its reversal demonstrate God's sovereignty?** Discuss how this pattern creates narrative tension and ultimate resolution.

3. **Compare and contrast Reuben's offer to Jacob with Judah's offer regarding Benjamin's safety. What does this reveal about their character development and understanding of justice?** Consider how Judah's experience in Genesis 38 shaped his approach.

4. **How does the author's deliberate use of "Jacob" versus "Israel" in the text reveal the patriarch's internal struggle between self-interest and trust in God?** Examine what triggers the name changes in the narrative.

5. **In what ways does Joseph's choice between vengeance and forgiveness represent the ultimate test of trust in God's story?** Explore how forgiveness requires faith that God will handle justice appropriately.

#### Brief Summary

BEMA Episode 16 concludes the Joseph narrative by revealing how personal experience becomes the lens through which God's messages are understood. Joseph's ability to interpret Pharaoh's dream stems from recognizing parallels to his own family's story of beautiful versus plain wives and seven-year periods of labor and waiting. The episode traces a deliberate narrative pattern of gifts, dreams, stripped coats, and pits that gets dramatically reversed when Pharaoh elevates Joseph from prisoner to prime minister.

The story's climax comes when Joseph's brothers arrive in Egypt, forcing him to choose his true identity: Egyptian son of Pharaoh or Hebrew son of Jacob. Judah's transformation from his experience with Tamar enables him to offer his own life for Benjamin's safety, moving Jacob from self-protective "Jacob" mode to surrendering "Israel" mode. This sets up Joseph's ultimate choice between vengeance and forgiveness.

The episode concludes by establishing forgiveness as the ultimate expression of trust in God's story - the willingness to lay down rights to revenge because of faith that God will handle justice appropriately. This theme of mutual sacrifice between Judah and Benjamin will echo throughout Hebrew scripture, establishing the pattern that defines God's people as those characterized by *chesed* (loyal love), justice, and the *chutzpah* to trust God's story even in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances.

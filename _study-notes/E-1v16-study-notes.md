### BEMA Discipleship Podcast Episode -1 (2016): "What Is BEMA?" Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA -1: What Is BEMA? (2016 Version)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon & Brent Billings  
**Source:** BEMA Discipleship Podcast (Pilot Episode)  
**Focus:** This introductory episode explains the origins, methodology, and vision behind the BEMA Discipleship program and podcast, emphasizing a Jewish hermeneutical approach to Scripture study and the importance of creating safe spaces for wrestling with faith questions.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Jewish Hermeneutic Approach:** BEMA centers on studying Scripture through a Jewish lens, recognizing that the Bible is "a Jewish book written by Jewish authors to a Jewish audience"

- **Safe Space for Wrestling:** The program prioritizes creating environments where difficult questions about faith can be asked without judgment, as these challenging areas often contain the greatest spiritual treasures

- **Four Pillars Framework:** BEMA operates on four foundational pillars: Text (better biblical understanding), Community (importance of relationship), Discipleship (pursuing Jesus's model), and Wrestling (engaging with difficult questions)

- **Historical Disconnection:** For 1,800 years, Jewish and Christian scholarship operated separately, only reconnecting in the 1970s through scholars like Jacob Neusner, creating new opportunities for biblical understanding

- **Deconstruction and Reconstruction:** Authentic biblical study requires "dumping out the file cabinet" of preconceived images and rebuilding understanding from a more historically accurate foundation

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The BEMA Concept

The name "BEMA" comes from the raised platform in ancient synagogues where Torah was read. Unlike modern church stages positioned at the front, the bema was placed in the center with the community gathered around it, symbolizing that Scripture—not human opinion—should be at the center of study and discussion.

##### Jewish Hermeneutical Recovery

Marty Solomon describes discovering teachers like Ray Vander Laan who approached Scripture through Jewish interpretive methods. This represented a significant shift from traditional Christian hermeneutics that had developed in isolation from Jewish thought since the early centuries of Christianity.

##### The Four Pillars Methodology

1. **Text:** Pursuing deeper, more accurate biblical understanding
2. **Community:** Recognizing the essential role of relationship in spiritual growth
3. **Discipleship:** Modeling Jesus's approach to disciple-making
4. **Wrestling:** Creating safe spaces for engaging difficult questions and doubts

##### First Century Discipleship Model

The program aims to recover elements of first-century Jewish discipleship practices that can be adapted for modern contexts, particularly targeting college-age students who can think independently but haven't yet become entrenched in established patterns.

##### The Neusner Bridge

Jacob Neusner's work in the 1970s created unprecedented dialogue between Jewish and Christian scholars, revealing how 2,000-year-old Jewish thought patterns could illuminate Jesus's teachings in ways previously unavailable to Christian interpretation.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Personal Journey Example

Solomon's own "crisis of faith" moment illustrates how traditional church environments often lack space for processing difficult questions. His trips to Israel in 2008 and 2010 provided transformative experiences that required "dumping out" his mental "file cabinet" of biblical images and starting over with more historically accurate understandings.

##### Campus Ministry Application

The BEMA program was initially implemented through Impact Campus Ministries on the Palouse (Moscow, Idaho and Pullman, Washington), targeting college students as an ideal demographic for this type of intensive biblical study and questioning.

##### Synagogue Architecture Lesson

The physical layout of ancient synagogues—with the bema platform in the center rather than at the front—provides a concrete example of how Jewish culture prioritized communal engagement with text over hierarchical teaching models.

##### Discussion Group Model

The podcast format allows for content delivery followed by local discussion groups, enabling the methodology to spread beyond the original geographic location while maintaining the community aspect essential to the approach.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

##### Historical Development

- The 1,800-year separation between Jewish and Christian scholarship
- Impact of Constantine and the Hellenization of Christianity
- Development of replacement theology and its effects on biblical interpretation

##### Jewish Interpretive Methods

- Specific hermeneutical techniques used in Jewish biblical study
- Comparison between Jewish and traditional Christian exegetical approaches
- Role of oral tradition and rabbinic commentary in understanding Scripture

##### First Century Context

- Daily life practices in first-century Palestine
- Educational methods of Jewish teachers and rabbis
- Social and religious structures that shaped Jesus's ministry

##### Modern Application Challenges

- Balancing historical context with contemporary relevance
- Navigating tensions between traditional Christian doctrine and Jewish interpretive insights
- Creating authentic community in individualistic Western culture

##### Theological Implications

- How Jewish hermeneutics might challenge or confirm traditional Christian doctrines
- The relationship between Christianity and Judaism in God's redemptive plan
- Implications for understanding Jesus's identity as both Jewish teacher and Christian Savior

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Methodological Understanding:** What are the four pillars of BEMA Discipleship, and how does each contribute to the overall approach to biblical study and spiritual formation?

2. **Historical Analysis:** Explain the significance of Jacob Neusner's work in the 1970s and how it bridged Jewish and Christian scholarship after 1,800 years of separation. What were the implications of this reconnection?

3. **Hermeneutical Shift:** How does studying Scripture as "a Jewish book written by Jewish authors to a Jewish audience" differ from traditional Christian approaches? What new questions might this perspective raise?

4. **Symbolic Architecture:** What does the placement of the bema platform in ancient synagogues reveal about Jewish approaches to Scripture study compared to modern church architecture and teaching methods?

5. **Application Challenge:** If you were to implement the BEMA methodology in your own context, what obstacles might you encounter, and how would you address the tension between creating a "safe space for wrestling" while maintaining theological integrity?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

This 2016 pilot episode reveals BEMA as more than just another Bible study program—it's a methodological revolution that challenges nearly two millennia of separated Jewish and Christian scholarship. Marty Solomon's personal journey from crisis to discovery illustrates the transformative power of approaching Scripture through its original Jewish context, while his four pillars framework provides practical structure for communities seeking deeper engagement with biblical text.

The episode's emphasis on creating safe spaces for wrestling with difficult questions feels particularly relevant in our current cultural moment, where many believers struggle with doubts but lack environments for honest exploration. The ancient synagogue's bema, positioned at the center rather than the front, serves as a powerful metaphor for keeping Scripture—rather than human interpretation—at the heart of spiritual community.

What strikes me most about this early vision is its balance between rigorous historical scholarship and accessible community application. BEMA doesn't require advanced degrees or seminary training, but it does demand intellectual honesty and the courage to question inherited assumptions. This democratization of serious biblical study, combined with the recovered Jewish hermeneutical insights, positions BEMA as a bridge between academic scholarship and grassroots spiritual formation—a bridge that the church has needed for centuries.

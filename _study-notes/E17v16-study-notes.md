### BEMA Episode 17: A God Who Hears the Cry - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 17 - A God Who Hears the Cry  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Focus:** Analysis of Moses' identity crisis, the Zipporah incident in Exodus 4:24-26, and understanding God's nature as revealed through stories of divine judgment in the Old Testament.

#### Key Takeaways

- Moses struggled with a profound identity crisis throughout his life, caught between his Hebrew birth and Egyptian upbringing
- God's primary concern is not our qualifications but our availability and trust
- The stories of "divine wrath" in the Old Testament (Sodom and Gomorrah, the Exodus) are actually stories of God hearing the cry of the oppressed and acting to restore justice
- Four Hebrew words link the stories of Sodom and Gomorrah with the Exodus, revealing consistent themes of God responding to oppression
- God's judgment (shaphat) is restorative rather than retributive, aimed at putting things back in their proper order
- The difference between discipline (from love) and punishment (from anger) reflects God's character

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Moses' Identity Crisis

Moses experienced deep psychological conflict throughout his life:
- Born to Hebrew parents (Jochebed - "glory to Ya" and Amram - "exalted people") but raised in Pharaoh's household
- Circumcised on the eighth day according to Hebrew law, making his Hebrew identity obvious
- Suffered from survivor's guilt, knowing he should have been killed with other Hebrew babies
- Lived with the tension of watching his people oppressed while enjoying Egyptian privilege
- His "speech impediment" may have been more about identity confusion than physical limitation

##### The Zipporah Incident (Exodus 4:24-26)

The strange story of Zipporah circumcising her son reveals:
- Moses had not circumcised his son, indicating his rejection of his covenant identity
- Zipporah's immediate knowledge of what to do suggests divine revelation
- The phrase "bridegroom of blood" (hatan) connects this story to larger biblical themes
- God's near-killing of Moses was related to his failure to embrace his calling as a covenant member

##### Four Connecting Words Between Judgment Stories

Hebrew linguistic analysis reveals four words that link Sodom/Gomorrah with the Exodus:

1. **Hatan** (bridegroom/son-in-law) - appears only 4 times in Torah, in both stories
2. **Rasha** (wickedness that causes oppression) - first 4 occurrences span both narratives
3. **Za'aq** (cry of oppression/injustice) - appears in both stories as the reason for God's intervention
4. **Shaphat** (restorative judgment) - God's response to put things back in proper order

##### Restorative vs. Retributive Justice

- Western justice systems focus on retribution and deterrence
- Ancient Eastern justice (mishpat/shaphat) focuses on restoration and healing
- God's "wrath" stories are actually stories of rescue, not punishment
- God responds to the cry (za'aq) of the oppressed, not primarily to punish sin

#### Examples & Applications

##### Parental Analogy
Just as a good parent intervenes not to punish the aggressor but to protect the victim, God's interventions in Sodom and Egypt were motivated by love for the oppressed rather than anger at the oppressor.

##### Modern Identity Struggles
Many people today, like Moses, struggle with feeling caught between worlds - cultural, religious, or social identities that don't seem to fit neatly together. God's call to Moses shows that our sense of not belonging doesn't disqualify us from God's purposes.

##### Academic and Professional Insecurities
Moses was the most qualified person for his mission yet felt completely inadequate. This reflects how our deepest insecurities often exist despite our actual qualifications and capabilities.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Detailed study of Hebrew justice concepts (mishpat vs. Western retributive justice)
- Cross-cultural analysis of identity formation in bicultural individuals
- Theological investigation of divine calling despite personal inadequacy
- Comparative analysis of "wrath of God" passages throughout Scripture
- Study of circumcision as covenant sign and identity marker in ancient Near Eastern context
- Investigation of the role of women (like Zipporah) as spiritual agents in Scripture

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does Moses' upbringing in Pharaoh's household both qualify and complicate his calling to deliver the Hebrews? What does this teach us about how God uses our backgrounds?

2. What is the significance of the four Hebrew words (hatan, rasha, za'aq, shaphat) that connect the Sodom and Gomorrah story with the Exodus narrative? How do they reveal God's character?

3. Explain the difference between restorative justice (shaphat/mishpat) and retributive justice. How does this understanding change your interpretation of God's "wrath" in the Old Testament?

4. Why hadn't Moses circumcised his son, and what does this reveal about his internal spiritual state? How does Zipporah's immediate response suggest divine guidance?

5. What does the statement "God is not interested in your qualifications; God is interested in your availability" mean in practical terms for modern believers facing feelings of inadequacy?

#### Personal Summary

This episode reveals that what we often interpret as stories of divine anger are actually profound demonstrations of God's love for the oppressed. Moses' identity crisis - feeling caught between Hebrew birth and Egyptian upbringing - mirrors many modern struggles with belonging and qualification. The key insight is that God doesn't call the qualified; He qualifies the called. The linguistic connections between Sodom/Gomorrah and the Exodus show a consistent pattern: God hears the cry (za'aq) of those suffering under wickedness (rasha) and responds with restorative judgment (shaphat) to restore proper order. This understanding transforms our view of the "wrathful God of the Old Testament" into a God who consistently intervenes on behalf of the powerless and oppressed, motivated by love rather than anger.

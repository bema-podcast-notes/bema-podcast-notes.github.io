# BEMA Episode 30: Lead with Your Voice - Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary
This episode examines the critical story of Moses striking the rock in Numbers 20, which results in his denial of entrance to the Promised Land. The teaching explores the deeper meaning behind this seemingly harsh punishment, focusing on the contrast between leading with authority/violence ("stick") versus leading with character and invitation ("voice"). The episode connects this incident to broader themes of Empire versus Shalom Kingdom throughout Scripture.

## Key Takeaways
- Moses is denied entrance to the Promised Land not for a simple mistake, but for reverting to Empire's methods of leadership through force and anger
- The story reveals the critical difference between "stick power" (coercion, violence, authority) and "voice power" (invitation, character-based leadership)
- Miriam's death and the lack of public mourning may have contributed to Moses' emotional state and poor decision-making
- The two rock-striking incidents (Exodus 17 and Numbers 20) are deliberately paralleled to show Moses' progression from obedience to disobedience
- God's holiness (kadosh) means He is fundamentally different from other gods - characterized by love, mercy, and restoration rather than violence
- Leaders are called to demonstrate God's character through their methodology, not just accomplish right outcomes through wrong means
- The placement of people "before the rock" parallels God's earlier positioning, suggesting Moses may have directed violence toward the people instead of taking it upon himself

## Main Concepts & Theories

**Two Kingdoms Paradigm:**
The episode reinforces the central BEMA framework of two competing narratives: the Kingdom of Empire (fear-based, using force/stick power, built on self-preservation) versus the Kingdom of Shalom (trust-based, using voice/invitation, built on self-sacrifice). Moses, despite having God's heart for justice, initially operated with Empire's tools and needed 40 years in the desert to learn God's methods.

**The Three Tests Framework:**
The teaching suggests this may be a "test of the soul" - where one withholds themselves from God unless God proves Himself worthy. This differs from tests of the heart (will/choice) and tests of might (using resources for others). Moses may have been testing God by essentially saying "these people don't deserve water unless they properly mourn my sister."

**Hagah Learning Method:**
The concept of hagah (Hebrew: rumbling/growling like a lion over prey) represents deep, meditative engagement with Scripture - "chewing" on the text to extract every possible meaning and connection, rather than surface-level reading.

**Priestly Leadership Model:**
The tabernacle served as a teaching tool where Israelites could observe literal priests to learn their calling as a "kingdom of priests." This connects to the leadership lesson that priests serve through character and invitation rather than coercion.

## Examples & Applications

**Modern Leadership Applications:**
- Pastors who lead through position/authority rather than character and humility
- Parents who rely on power and control rather than relationship and guidance
- Managers who coerce compliance rather than inspire commitment
- Political leaders who use force and fear rather than moral persuasion

**Biblical Parallels:**
- The Balaam story immediately follows, featuring a donkey that speaks while the prophet beats it with a stick - reinforcing the voice vs. stick theme
- Pharaoh's use of the staff for oppression versus Moses' intended use for liberation
- Jesus' rejection of worldly power and His emphasis on servant leadership

**Historical Context:**
- Moses' 40-year shepherding experience taught him voice-based leadership methods
- The Exodus plagues demonstrated God's power without requiring Moses to use violence
- The tabernacle system provided visual education in priestly service and character

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration
- The midrashic traditions about Miriam's role in providing water and the "well on a cart"
- Paul's reference in 1 Corinthians 10:4 to "the rock that accompanied them" and its connection to Jewish tradition
- The significance of place names (Kadesh, Meribah, Massah) and their theological meanings
- Rabbi David Fohrman's teachings on this passage at Aleph Beta
- The connection between Moses' anger and modern pastoral burnout or leadership failure
- The role of grief and unprocessed emotions in leadership decisions
- The contrast between Aaron's public mourning versus the lack of mourning for Miriam
- Josh Bossé's Session 6 teaching that potentially vindicates the people's complaints
- The theological implications of Moses potentially killing two people when he "struck twice"
- The development of Moses' character from palace violence through shepherding to this failure

## Comprehension Questions

1. According to the teaching, what is the fundamental difference between "stick power" and "voice power" in leadership, and how does this relate to the Kingdom of Empire versus Kingdom of Shalom paradigm?

2. Why might the lack of public mourning for Miriam be significant to understanding Moses' emotional state and subsequent actions in Numbers 20?

3. How do the parallel structures between Exodus 17 and Numbers 20 (the two rock-striking incidents) help illuminate what Moses was supposed to learn versus what he actually did?

4. What does it mean that Moses failed to show God as "holy" (kadosh) before the people, and how does this connect to the broader biblical understanding of God's character?

5. In what ways does the Balaam story that follows serve to reinforce the theological lessons about voice versus stick leadership that Moses failed to demonstrate?

## Brief Personalized Summary

This episode challenges conventional explanations for Moses' punishment by revealing a deeper issue of leadership methodology. Rather than simply making a mistake, Moses reverted to the Empire's way of leading through anger, force, and positional authority instead of demonstrating God's character of love, mercy, and invitation. The teaching suggests that effective biblical leadership comes not from having the right to command, but from developing the kind of character that makes people want to follow. This has profound implications for anyone in leadership positions - whether pastoral, parental, or professional - showing that how we accomplish good things matters as much as what we accomplish. The episode serves as both a warning about the dangers of unprocessed grief affecting our leadership and an invitation to examine whether we lead like Pharaoh (through coercion) or like the Good Shepherd (through voice and character).

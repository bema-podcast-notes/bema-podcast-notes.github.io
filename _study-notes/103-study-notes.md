# BEMA Episode 103: Healing in His Wings - Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** 103 - Healing in His Wings  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings
**Focus:** Matthew 9:18-38, Numbers 15:37-41, Malachi 4:1-3, Ezekiel 34

This episode explores the final section of Matthew 9, examining several healing stories that demonstrate Jesus bringing Shalom (peace, wholeness) to people's chaos. The episode focuses particularly on the cultural and textual context behind the woman with the issue of blood who touches the tzitzit (tassel) of Jesus's garment, connecting this act to messianic expectations from Malachi. The discussion emphasizes how Jesus's actions are always rooted in and commenting on the Hebrew Text, revealing him as someone who knows and fulfills Scripture while challenging the religious establishment's failure to shepherd God's people.

## Key Takeaways

- Everything Jesus does and teaches is a commentary on the Hebrew Text, not just random wisdom or miraculous acts
- The woman with the issue of blood deliberately touched Jesus's tzitzit (tassel) based on her knowledge of Malachi 4:2, which speaks of healing in the Messiah's "wings" (kanafot)
- Jesus uses the "messianic secret" strategically based on location - freely allowing miracles to be shared in pagan areas but restricting them in the religious triangle where misunderstanding could cause problems
- The religious leadership (Pharisees) had failed as shepherds of God's people, leaving them "harassed and helpless" as described in Ezekiel 34
- The "harvest is plentiful but the workers are few" may not be about evangelism but about God's abundant blessings not reaching the people who need them most (the mamzer - outcasts)
- Understanding the cultural context of items like the tallit and tzitzit is essential for grasping the full meaning of Gospel stories

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Tallit and Tzitzit

The tallit is the prayer shawl or outer garment worn by Jewish men based on Numbers 15:37-41, which commands God's people to put tzitziot (tassels) on the kanafot (corners/wings) of their garments. These tassels served as tactile, physical reminders of:
- Their identity as God's people
- Their covenant obligations to obey God's commands
- Protection under God's "wings"

In first-century Jewish culture, these tassels were worn on the outer garment. Today, some Jews wear a tallit katan (small tallit) underneath their clothing like a sandwich board. The rabbis had to work out how to find "corners" on circular robes, which led to the development of rectangular prayer shawls that naturally had corners for the tassels.

### Healing in His Wings - Malachi 4:2

A messianic legend existed among first-century Jews based on Malachi 4:2, which states "for you who fear my name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings" (ESV). The Hebrew word kanaf means both "corner" and "wing," creating a wordplay between:
- The corners of the garment where tzitzit are placed
- God's protective wings
- The healing that would come through Messiah's "wings"

The woman with the issue of blood, having been unclean and excluded from temple and synagogue worship for 12 years, knew her Text well enough to recognize this messianic sign. Her deliberate touching of Jesus's tzitzit was an act of faith declaring, "I believe you are Messiah because there is healing in your kanafot."

### The Messianic Secret

Jesus's inconsistent responses to publicity about his miracles follow a pattern based on location:
- **In pagan areas (Decapolis):** Jesus tells people to go and tell everyone what happened
- **In the religious triangle (Galilee):** Jesus tells people not to tell anyone and conducts healings privately

This strategy reflects Jesus's awareness that:
- The religiously self-righteous Jewish establishment would misinterpret and resist his ministry
- People steeped in religiosity would call his miracles demonic rather than recognize God's work
- The broader Jewish religious culture was not ready to process the implications of outcasts being brought into the assembly
- More groundwork needed to be laid before public proclamation would be effective

### Sheep Without a Shepherd - Ezekiel 34

Jesus's compassion for crowds who were "harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd" directly references Ezekiel 34, which condemns Israel's shepherds (religious leaders) for:
- Only taking care of themselves rather than the flock
- Not strengthening the weak, healing the sick, or binding up the injured
- Not bringing back strays or searching for the lost
- Ruling harshly and brutally over God's people
- Allowing the sheep to be scattered with no one to search for them

Jesus's healing ministry directly addresses each of these failures - he strengthens the weak, heals the sick, binds up the injured, brings back strays, and searches for the lost. His actions demonstrate what true shepherding looks like in contrast to the Pharisees' misguided focus on obedience at the expense of compassion.

### The Harvest and the Workers

The traditional interpretation of "the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few" as a call for more evangelists or clergy may need reconsideration. An alternative reading suggests:
- In biblical texts, harvest represents God's blessing, not unsaved people
- The only place "workers" and "harvest" appear together is in Ruth, where workers gather the harvest but also where the poor (like Ruth) glean what's left behind
- Jesus may be saying God's blessings are abundant, but no one is gathering them to distribute to those who need them
- This fits Matthew's agenda of highlighting the mamzer (outcasts) who are being overlooked
- The point may be less about recruiting more clergy and more about ensuring God's abundant provision reaches the harassed and helpless

## Examples & Applications

### The Woman's Chutzpah

The woman with the issue of blood demonstrated remarkable courage (chutzpah) by:
- Pushing through a crowd when she may have been ritually unclean
- Deliberately touching a rabbi's garment despite her status
- Risking social condemnation to act on her knowledge of Scripture
- Persisting in faith despite 12 years of exclusion from religious community

Her story shows that knowing Scripture deeply - even when excluded from formal religious education and assembly - can lead to life-changing encounters with God.

### David and Saul's Tzitzit

When David cut off the corner of Saul's robe in the cave (1 Samuel 24), he wasn't just cutting fabric - he was cutting off Saul's tzitzit. This explains David's guilt because:
- The tassel symbolized Saul's obedience to God
- The tassel also represented God's protection over Saul
- David felt he had presumed to decide Saul was no longer under God's protection
- The act carried much deeper spiritual and symbolic weight than a simple cloth-cutting

### Professional Mourners

The culture employed professional mourners who:
- Knew appropriate songs, hymns, and prayers for grief
- Helped families navigate the one-week mourning period
- Provided structure and guidance during loss

Rather than being a strange custom, this practice recognized that grief requires guidance and community support - something modern Western culture often lacks.

### Location Determines Strategy

Jesus's ministry demonstrates that:
- Context matters when sharing truth
- Some environments are more receptive than others
- Religious self-righteousness can be a greater barrier than paganism
- Strategic wisdom is needed about when and how to share

This applies to modern believers who must discern appropriate contexts and methods for sharing faith rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration

1. **Messianic Prophecies and Jewish Interpretation:** Study rabbinic literature on messianic expectations in the Second Temple period, particularly regarding Malachi 4:2 and the "healing in his wings" tradition

2. **Ritual Purity Laws:** Examine Levitical purity laws regarding bleeding, skin diseases, and other conditions to understand the social isolation experienced by people Jesus healed

3. **The Blind Men and Son of David:** Investigate potential textual connections between blindness, the title "Son of David," and messianic expectations (particularly 2 Samuel 5 and David's statement about the "blind and lame")

4. **Ezekiel 34 and Shepherding Imagery:** Study the complete chapter of Ezekiel 34, along with Jeremiah's prophecies about shepherds, to understand the prophetic critique of Israel's leadership

5. **Ruth and the Harvest:** Examine the book of Ruth as a model for how God's abundant provision should be shared with the vulnerable and marginalized

6. **Matthew's Mamzer Theme:** Track throughout Matthew's Gospel how Jesus consistently prioritizes and includes those deemed unfit for the assembly (mamzer)

7. **The Tallit Through History:** Research the development of the tallit from ancient times through the Second Temple period to understand how Jewish practice evolved

8. **Remez and Rabbinical Interpretation:** Study the rabbinic interpretive technique of remez (hinting) and how Jesus uses subtle textual allusions to make profound theological points

9. **Compassion vs. Legalism:** Analyze the tension between strict Torah observance and compassionate application throughout the Gospel narratives

10. **Prayer Shawl Traditions:** Examine modern Jewish prayer shawl practices and their connection to ancient customs to better understand Jesus's cultural context

## Comprehension Questions

1. **What is the significance of the woman with the issue of blood specifically touching the tzitzit (tassel) of Jesus's garment rather than just touching Jesus himself? How does this connect to Malachi 4:2 and messianic expectations?**

2. **How does Jesus's use of the "messianic secret" differ based on location, and what does this reveal about his strategic approach to ministry? Compare his instructions to the Decapolis demoniac with his instructions to the blind men in the religious triangle.**

3. **What does Ezekiel 34 reveal about the failures of Israel's religious leadership, and how does Jesus's ministry directly address each of these failures? Give specific examples from Matthew 9.**

4. **Why might the traditional interpretation of "the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few" need reconsideration? What alternative meaning could this phrase have based on its textual connections?**

5. **How does understanding that Jesus's every action is rooted in and commenting on the Hebrew Text change how we read the Gospel stories? What questions should we be asking as we study Jesus's words and deeds?**

## Personal Summary

This episode powerfully demonstrates that the Gospel narratives are far richer than surface-level readings suggest. The woman with the issue of blood wasn't just desperately grabbing at Jesus in a crowd - she was making a deliberate theological statement based on deep knowledge of Scripture, declaring her belief that Jesus was the Messiah promised in Malachi who would bring "healing in his wings." Her 12 years of exclusion from religious community didn't prevent her from knowing the Text; instead, it may have deepened her hunger for it.

Jesus's strategic use of the messianic secret reveals his awareness that religious self-righteousness can be a greater barrier to truth than outright paganism. The very people who should have recognized him - those steeped in Torah and tradition - were the ones most resistant to what God was doing. Meanwhile, those deemed unfit for the assembly - the mamzer, the outcasts, the ritually impure - were the ones pressing in with faith.

The episode's exploration of shepherding imagery from Ezekiel 34 exposes how Israel's religious leaders had failed God's people, leaving them "harassed and helpless." Jesus's ministry becomes a direct counterpoint to this failure, as he strengthens the weak, heals the sick, searches for the lost, and brings Shalom to chaos. His compassion stands in stark contrast to the harsh, brutal religiosity that scattered the flock.

Most challenging is the reinterpretation of "the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few." Rather than a call for more evangelists or clergy, this may be Jesus lamenting that God's abundant blessings aren't reaching those who need them most. The harvest - God's provision - sits waiting while the overlooked and marginalized go without. This reading aligns perfectly with Matthew's consistent theme of Jesus prioritizing the mamzer and redefining who belongs in God's Kingdom.

The episode reinforces a crucial hermeneutical principle: everything in the Gospels is rooted in the Hebrew Text. Jesus isn't offering random wisdom nuggets or performing miracles merely for spectacle. Every word, every action is commentary on the ongoing story God has been telling through Scripture. To truly understand the Gospels, we must ask not just "what did Jesus say and do?" but "what Text is Jesus commenting on, and why?"

# BEMA Episode 32: Session 1 Capstone - Study Notes

## Title & Source Summary
BEMA Episode 32 serves as the capstone review for Session 1, providing a comprehensive summary of the Books of Moses (Torah). Hosts Marty Solomon and Brent Billings synthesize the foundational narrative of Genesis through Deuteronomy, establishing Torah as the essential foundation for understanding all subsequent biblical literature and God's redemptive plan.

## Key Takeaways
- Torah (the Books of Moses) establishes the foundational partnership between God and His people
- Genesis serves as both preface (Genesis 1-11) and introduction (Genesis 12-50) to God's redemptive narrative
- The central theme of Scripture is "Empire versus Shalom" - a tale of two kingdoms competing for allegiance
- The tabernacle functions as honeymoon suite, mobile creation story, and training ground for priesthood
- Leviticus serves as the manual for learning how to be a kingdom of priests
- Remembering where we came from (especially our status as aliens, orphans, and widows) is essential for caring for others in similar situations
- The narrative of biblical history must be understood chronologically rather than following the order of books in our Bibles

## Main Concepts & Theories

### The Structure of Genesis
Genesis is divided into two main sections:
- **Preface (Genesis 1-11)**: Introduces the big ideas - who God is, what the world is, who mankind is, and what God is doing. Establishes that creation is fundamentally good (tov me'od) and that God is trustworthy, though humanity repeatedly fails to trust the story.
- **Introduction (Genesis 12-50)**: Presents the family of God (AIJJ - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph) who, despite their dysfunction and humanity, learn to trust God's redemptive story.

### Empire versus Shalom Framework
Two competing narratives run throughout Scripture:
- **Empire**: Built on fear, coercion, power, wealth, security, and self-preservation
- **Shalom/Kingdom of God**: Built on generosity, invitation, trust, and self-sacrifice

### The Marriage Metaphor
Exodus presents God's relationship with Israel through marriage imagery:
- **Rescue**: God takes His betrothed out of Egypt through the Passover
- **Wedding**: The covenant ceremony at Mount Sinai
- **Honeymoon Suite**: The tabernacle as the place of intimate relationship
- **Desert Honeymoon**: The book of Numbers as the time of getting to know each other

### The Priesthood Training Program
God's plan for Israel as a "kingdom of priests" includes:
- The tabernacle as a visual training ground in the center of camp
- Leviticus as the priesthood manual covering atonement, priestly duties, holy living, celebration, and care for the oppressed
- Learning through observation of the Levitical priests

### The AOWs (Alien, Orphan, Widow)
Deuteronomy's repeated emphasis on caring for society's most vulnerable creates a cyclical remembrance: remembering our own experience as aliens, orphans, and widows in Egypt motivates us to care for those in similar circumstances today.

## Examples & Applications

### Modern Applications of the Empire vs. Shalom Framework
- **Empire mentality in churches**: Building programs focused on institutional preservation rather than community service
- **Shalom approach to leadership**: Leading through invitation and generosity rather than coercion and control
- **Economic systems**: Capitalism's focus on accumulation vs. biblical principles of sharing and jubilee

### The Tabernacle as Training Model
Just as Israel learned priesthood by watching the Levites work daily, modern discipleship happens through:
- Modeling rather than just teaching
- Creating visible examples of faithful living in community
- Learning through repetitive observation of godly practices

### Remembrance and Social Justice
The principle of remembering our own vulnerability applies to:
- Immigrants and refugees (aliens)
- Children without family support (orphans)  
- Single mothers and elderly without family support (widows)
- Any marginalized or vulnerable populations

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration
- The chiastic structure of the tabernacle as a retelling of Genesis 1
- The connection between Sabbath, festivals, and remembering God's goodness
- How the "tale of two kingdoms" plays out in the prophetic literature
- The development of priesthood concepts from Exodus through Malachi
- Comparison between ancient Near Eastern covenant treaties and the Sinai covenant
- The role of hospitality in ancient cultures and its theological significance
- How Jesus fulfills the patterns established in Torah
- The relationship between individual and corporate identity in Hebrew thought
- The function of narrative in shaping worldview and behavior

## Comprehension Questions
1. How does the preface of Genesis (chapters 1-11) set up the problems that the rest of Scripture addresses, and why is trusting God's story so central to the solution?

2. Explain the "Empire versus Shalom" framework and provide specific examples of how these two kingdoms operate differently in their approach to power, resources, and relationships.

3. What is the significance of Israel being called a "kingdom of priests," and how does the tabernacle and Leviticus function as training tools for this calling?

4. Why does Deuteronomy repeatedly emphasize caring for "the alien, the orphan, and the widow," and how does this connect to Israel's experience in Egypt?

5. According to Marty Solomon, why is it important to study the Bible chronologically rather than simply following the order of books, and what difference might this make in understanding God's narrative?

## Brief Personalized Summary
Episode 32 brilliantly synthesizes the entire Torah into a coherent narrative about God seeking partnership to restore His good creation. Rather than five disconnected books, the Torah tells the story of God choosing, defining, shaping, and calling His partner to remember their shared mission. The foundational themes of trusting God's goodness, living as priests in a broken world, and caring for the vulnerable establish the framework for understanding all subsequent biblical literature. This episode reinforces that without a solid grounding in Torah, we lack the proper foundation and vocabulary to understand the prophets, wisdom literature, and ultimately Jesus himself. The transition from Session 1 to Session 2 promises to show how this partnership plays out in the concrete realities of biblical history.

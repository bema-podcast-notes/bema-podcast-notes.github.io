### BEMA Episode 17: A God Who Hears the Cry - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 17: A God Who Hears the Cry (E17v24)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon and Brent Billings  
**Focus:** Examining the identity crisis of Moses and the nature of God as one who responds to cries for help rather than simply punishing sin. This episode serves as a bridge between Genesis and Exodus, exploring fundamental questions of identity, calling, and God's character through the lens of Moses' reluctance and the Zipporah circumcision story.

#### Key Takeaways

- Moses struggled with an identity crisis, feeling unworthy to represent the Hebrew people due to his upbringing in Pharaoh's house
- God is more interested in our availability than our qualifications for His calling
- The phrase "uncircumcised lips" reveals Moses' deeper spiritual struggle with accepting his covenant identity
- Stories commonly labeled as "God's wrath" (Sodom and Gomorrah, Egyptian plagues) are actually stories of God responding to cries for justice and restoration
- God operates from a restorative justice mindset (mishpat) rather than purely retributive justice (diyn)
- The Hebrew concept of hagah teaches us to "growl" over Scripture like a lion with prey, seeking deeper understanding

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Moses' Identity Crisis and Qualification vs. Availability
Moses represents the tension between human insecurity and divine calling. Despite being the most qualified person to lead the Exodus (raised in Pharaoh's house, understanding Egyptian culture, knowing Hebrew heritage), Moses felt disqualified due to his complex identity. His repeated excuses about being "slow of speech" evolving into "uncircumcised of lips" reveal a deeper spiritual issue - rejection of his covenant identity.

**Key principle:** "God isn't interested in your qualifications. He's interested in your availability."

##### The Zipporah Story as Identity Marker
The strange account in Exodus 4:24-26 serves as a crucial narrative bridge. Moses' son being uncircumcised suggests Moses had distanced himself from his Hebrew identity. Zipporah's quick action with the "bridegroom of blood" ceremony forces Moses to confront his covenant obligations and embrace his role in God's story.

##### Hebrew Word Study - Literary Connections
Four Hebrew terms connect the "wrath" stories of Sodom/Gomorrah and the Exodus:
- **Hatan** (bridegroom/son-in-law) - appears only 4 times in Torah, twice in each story
- **Rasha** (wickedness) - first 4 appearances connect these narratives  
- **Tsa'aqah** (cry of distress) - the specific cry of the oppressed that moves God to action
- **Shaphat** (to judge) - the root of mishpat (restorative justice)

##### Restorative vs. Retributive Justice
**Mishpat** (restorative justice) focuses on making things right and restoring shalom (peace/wholeness). **Diyn** (retributive justice) focuses on punishment. God's primary motivation is restoration, not retribution. When God "hears the cry," He responds to injustice with the goal of making things whole again.

##### The Hagah Method of Scripture Study
**Hagah** - Hebrew onomatopoeia mimicking a lion's low growl over prey. This represents the intensive, persistent study approach where believers "growl" over Scripture, refusing to let go until deeper meaning emerges. The method involves asking increasingly sophisticated questions rather than accepting surface-level interpretations.

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Context Examples
- **Moses in Pharaoh's House:** Like modern individuals caught between cultures, Moses experienced survivor's guilt and identity confusion
- **Native American Tribal Courts:** Modern example of restorative vs. retributive justice systems, illustrating the Hebrew mishpat concept
- **Parental Discipline:** A father stopping children from fighting primarily seeks restoration of household peace, not punishment

##### Modern Applications
- **Identity and Calling:** Many feel disqualified from God's work due to background or perceived inadequacies
- **Justice Work:** Understanding God as one who "hears the cry" empowers believers to engage in justice work as participation in God's character
- **Scripture Study:** The hagah method encourages deeper, more persistent Bible study rather than superficial reading

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **The role of circumcision as identity marker in ancient Hebrew culture**
- **Comparative study of ancient Near Eastern justice systems**
- **The theological implications of God's "wrath" stories in broader biblical narrative**
- **Moses' psychological development from prince to prophet to leader**
- **The concept of corporate vs. individual identity in Hebrew thought**
- **Ray Vander Laan's "That the World May Know" series, particularly Volume 8: "God Heard Their Cry"**
- **The literary structure and function of genealogies in Hebrew narrative**

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis:** How does Moses' progression from "slow of speech and tongue" to "uncircumcised lips" reveal his deeper spiritual struggle, and what does this teach us about the relationship between identity and calling?

2. **Synthesis:** Compare and contrast the concepts of mishpat (restorative justice) and diyn (retributive justice). How does this distinction change our understanding of God's character in the "wrath" narratives?

3. **Application:** What does it mean that "God is more interested in your availability than your qualifications," and how might this principle apply to modern believers who feel inadequate for God's calling?

4. **Literary Analysis:** Explain the significance of the four Hebrew words (hatan, rasha, tsa'aqah, shaphat) that connect the Sodom/Gomorrah and Exodus narratives. What theological point does this literary connection make?

5. **Interpretive:** How does understanding God as "one who hears the cry" rather than primarily as a punisher of sin change the way we read stories like Sodom and Gomorrah or the Egyptian plagues?

#### Personal Summary

This episode fundamentally challenges common misconceptions about God's character while addressing universal human struggles with identity and calling. Moses' journey from reluctant leader to willing participant in God's story mirrors our own tensions between feeling qualified and being available. The deep dive into Hebrew terminology reveals that what we often categorize as "Old Testament wrath" is actually God's consistent character of responding to injustice with restorative love.

The hagah method of Scripture study presented here offers a practical approach to discovering these deeper truths - approaching the Bible like a lion with prey, unwilling to let go until we've extracted the spiritual nourishment within. This episode serves as both a transition point in the biblical narrative and a foundational understanding of God's heart for justice and restoration that will inform the entire Exodus account.

Most significantly, the episode presents a God who is fundamentally motivated by love and restoration rather than anger and punishment - a God who hears the cry of the oppressed and acts to restore shalom to His creation.

### BEMA Episode 25: A Kingdom of What? - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

This episode provides a comprehensive overview of the book of Leviticus, examining it as an "owner's manual" for the tabernacle and exploring what it means to be a "kingdom of priests" as outlined in Exodus 19:5-6. Rather than a verse-by-verse analysis, this episode takes a 10,000-foot view to understand Leviticus as a cohesive whole, organized around the central theme of priesthood and atonement.

#### Key Takeaways

- Leviticus serves as the "owner's manual" for the tabernacle - explaining how to use what was built in Exodus
- The book is structured as a chiasm with the Day of Atonement at its center, emphasizing God's desire to forgive sin
- Being a "kingdom of priests" means all Israelites (and by extension, Christians) are called to four priestly roles
- The Levitical laws are not arbitrary restrictions but ways to set God's people apart to display His character
- Atonement comes first before any other religious activity, emphasizing grace over performance
- The book includes instructions on proper celebration and caring for the oppressed as essential priestly duties

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Structure of Leviticus (Chiasm)

Leviticus is organized as a chiasm (sandwich structure) with five main sections:

**Section 1: Atonement (Chapters 1-7)**
- Focus: Sacrificial system and making things right with God
- Purpose: Establishes grace before works, ensuring relationship is secure before duties begin
- Not about constant animal sacrifice - one goat morning and evening for the whole nation
- Creates foundation where everything else flows from love, not performance

**Section 2: Priesthood Part 1 (Chapters 8-10)**
- Instructions for priestly conduct and special rules
- Higher standards for priests who represent God to the people
- Part of the "priest-wich" structure

**Section 3: Holiness Code (Chapters 11-20)**
- The "filling" of the priest-wich
- Laws about kosher eating, clothing, farming, and relationships
- Purpose: Making Israel distinct from surrounding nations
- Not about inherent good/evil but about being set apart (kadosh = holy/different)

**Section 4: How to Party (Chapters 23-24)**
- Biblical festivals and celebrations
- God-ordained parties that celebrate His goodness and provision
- Required celebration - "You will party or you will die"
- Proper celebration changes hearts and leads to generosity

**Section 5: Caring for the Oppressed (Chapters 25-27)**
- Sabbath year and Year of Jubilee
- Debt forgiveness and land redistribution
- Redemption prices for restoring people to community
- Natural result of experiencing God's grace through celebration

##### The Four Roles of Priesthood

**1. Put God on Display**
- Dress and act differently to show God is different
- Visual reminder of God's character through lifestyle choices
- Like the blue thread in tassels among white threads
- Modern application: Ethical consumption, relationships, social media use

**2. Help People Navigate Their Atonement**
- Guide people through the process of restoration with God
- Use rules as tools for ministry, not ends in themselves
- Help move people from guilty to clean conscience
- Some offerings included communal meals for reconciliation

**3. Intercede on Behalf of Others**
- Stand between God and people, advocating both directions
- Plead God's case to people and people's case to God
- Like Moses on Mount Sinai willing to have his name blotted out
- Find loopholes and opportunities to bring people in, not keep them out

**4. Distribute Resources to Those in Need**
- Manage systems that care for alien, orphan, and widow
- Share abundance with those lacking
- Ensure God's household cares for all His children
- Can include material goods, emotional health, community, relationships

##### The Day of Atonement as Central Theme

- Located at the center of the Levitical chiasm (Chapter 16)
- Emphasizes that God's primary desire is to forgive sin
- The scapegoat carries sins "as far as east is from west"
- Demonstrates that Leviticus is ultimately about grace, not burden
- Shows that "the Law was the gospel" - good news about God's forgiveness

#### Examples & Applications

##### Real-World Priestly Living

**Putting God on Display:**
- Ethical shopping and consumption patterns that reflect God's values
- Social media presence that demonstrates God's character
- Relationship patterns that show God's love and faithfulness
- Financial stewardship that reflects trust in God's provision

**Helping with Atonement:**
- Creating environments where people experience God's love rather than judgment
- Helping people move from shame to acceptance
- Providing practical steps for spiritual restoration
- Offering multiple pathways for people to connect with God

**Intercession:**
- Advocating for marginalized groups rather than excluding them
- Finding ways to include rather than exclude
- Standing up for those society rejects
- Being a bridge-builder between God and community

**Resource Distribution:**
- Food banks, homeless shelters, financial assistance programs
- Mentoring, counseling, community building
- Sharing skills, networks, and opportunities
- Creating systems that address root causes of poverty

##### Historical Context Examples

**Ancient vs. Modern Understanding:**
- Leviticus 27's "redemption prices" seem offensive until understood as revolutionary human dignity legislation
- Mixed fabrics seem arbitrary until seen as priestly distinctiveness markers
- Kosher laws appear health-based but actually serve identity formation purposes
- Festival requirements seem excessive until recognized as mental health and community building practices

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Structural Understanding:** How does the chiastic structure of Leviticus with the Day of Atonement at its center change your understanding of the book's main message?

2. **Priestly Roles Application:** Which of the four priestly roles (displaying God, helping with atonement, interceding, distributing resources) do you find most challenging to implement in modern Christian life, and why?

3. **Holiness Code Purpose:** Explain why the dietary laws, clothing restrictions, and farming practices in Leviticus 11-20 were given. How might the principle behind these laws apply today without necessarily following the specific rules?

4. **Atonement Priority:** Why does Leviticus begin with atonement (chapters 1-7) rather than jumping directly into priestly duties? What does this teach about the relationship between grace and works?

5. **Celebration Mandate:** How does the concept of God-required celebration (chapters 23-24) challenge common Christian attitudes toward enjoyment and pleasure? What is the connection between proper celebration and caring for the oppressed?

#### Personal Summary

The book of Leviticus reveals God's heart for relationship over religion, grace over performance, and community care over individual piety. Far from being a burden of arbitrary rules, Leviticus provides a comprehensive blueprint for living as God's representatives in the world. The central message is beautifully captured in its chiastic structure: God desires to forgive our sins and restore relationship (Day of Atonement) so that we can effectively serve as His priests to the world.

The four priestly roles - displaying God's character, helping others find restoration, interceding for the marginalized, and distributing resources to meet needs - provide a practical framework for Christian discipleship. These roles challenge us to examine whether our lives truly look different from the surrounding culture in ways that point to God's unique character of love, mercy, and justice.

Most remarkably, Leviticus teaches that proper worship includes both solemn acknowledgment of our need for atonement and joyful celebration of God's goodness. This balance prevents both legalistic guilt and careless presumption. The book concludes with practical applications of grace through debt forgiveness, land redistribution, and human dignity restoration, showing that experiencing God's mercy should naturally lead to extending mercy to others.

For modern believers, Leviticus offers not a list of rules to follow but a vision of what it means to live as a kingdom of priests - people set apart not for privilege but for service, displaying God's radical love in a world desperately needing to see His true character.

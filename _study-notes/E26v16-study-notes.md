### BEMA Episode 26 Study Notes: Images of the Desert — Shepherd

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 26: Images of the Desert — Shepherd (2017)
**Topic:** An introduction to desert imagery in Scripture, focusing specifically on the biblical concept of shepherding as preparation for studying the book of Numbers and Israel's 40-year wilderness journey.

#### Key Takeaways

- The desert (Hebrew: *midbar*) is fundamentally connected to concepts of word, speaking, and listening in biblical Hebrew
- Shepherding in the biblical world differs dramatically from Western pastoral imagery - it occurs in desert environments with scarce resources
- The shepherd leads through voice, not force - sheep follow only their shepherd's voice and will not follow strangers
- Desert experiences teach lessons of "just enough" rather than abundance, fostering dependence on God
- Biblical shepherds were typically young women, making Moses and David's shepherding roles culturally unusual
- Mixed flocks of sheep and goats illustrate different responses to the shepherd's voice - sheep obey, goats follow their own way

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Hebrew Word Tree for Desert (*midbar*)
The root DBR connects multiple desert-related concepts:
- *Dabar* - word
- *Diber* - to speak  
- *Midbar* - desert
- *Madbir* - shepherd
- *Dober* - pasture
- *Divir* - sheepfold

This linguistic connection reveals that the desert is understood as the place where one learns to speak, listen, and receive God's word.

##### Shepherd Leadership Model
Unlike Egyptian pharaonic leadership (rule by the stick), shepherds lead through:
- Voice commands that sheep recognize and follow
- Providing "just enough" - finding small tufts of grass and still water pools
- Leading from behind the flock normally, but moving to the center during danger
- Building trust through consistent provision rather than force

##### Desert as Spiritual Formation
Bruce Feiler's observation: "Because the place is demanding, it builds character. Because it's destructive, it builds interdependence. Because it's isolating, it builds community. And because it's a desert, it builds nations."

The desert teaches:
- Dependence on God's daily provision
- How to be "people of the ears" rather than "people of the eyes"
- Trust in God's faithfulness despite circumstances
- Living with "just enough" rather than abundance

##### Psalm 23 Reinterpreted
Through desert lens, familiar phrases gain new meaning:
- "Green pastures" = small tufts of grass between desert rocks
- "Still waters" = rare pools of water collected in wadis after rain
- "Paths of righteousness" = actual paths worn by thousands of years of sheep following the same routes
- "Valley of the shadow of death" = dangerous terrain where shepherd moves to center of flock

#### Examples & Applications

##### Biblical Shepherds
- Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph - all desert people
- Moses - shepherded for 40 years before leading Israel
- David - likely helped his sisters tend flocks as a young boy
- Many prophets had shepherding backgrounds

##### Modern Desert Lessons
Personal "desert" experiences in life serve similar formative purposes:
- Teaching dependence on God rather than self-sufficiency
- Developing trust in God's provision
- Learning to listen for God's voice amid difficulties
- Building character through challenging circumstances

##### Sheep vs. Goats Distinction
In Jesus' parables, this reflects different responses to God's voice:
- Sheep: Follow the shepherd's commands (feed hungry, visit prisoners, care for sick)
- Goats: Know a "better way," follow their own path while still claiming to follow the shepherd

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Ray Vander Laan's "Walking with God in the Desert" series (Volume 12 of *That the World May Know*)
- Kenneth Bailey's work *The Good Shepherd* for deeper understanding of Middle Eastern shepherding
- Connection between desert experiences and the Exodus narrative
- How desert imagery appears throughout biblical prophecy and Jesus' teachings
- The role of hospitality in desert culture and its connection to Abraham's example
- Comparison of Empire leadership (Egyptian pharaoh's stick) versus Kingdom leadership (shepherd's voice)

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Linguistic Analysis:** How does the Hebrew word tree based on the root DBR (word/speak) connect the concepts of desert, shepherd, and divine communication?

2. **Cultural Context:** In what ways does understanding that biblical shepherds were typically young women change our interpretation of stories about Moses, David, and the Christmas shepherds?

3. **Leadership Contrast:** How does the shepherd's method of leading through voice rather than force contrast with pharaoh's leadership model, and what does this teach about God's approach to leadership?

4. **Resource Perspective:** What is the significance of the desert teaching lessons of "just enough" rather than abundance, and how might this apply to modern spiritual formation?

5. **Spiritual Application:** Using the sheep and goats imagery from mixed flocks, how can we evaluate whether we are truly following the shepherd's voice or following our own preferred path?

#### Personal Summary

Episode 26 fundamentally reframes our understanding of biblical imagery by grounding it in the harsh realities of Middle Eastern desert life. Rather than the lush green pastures of Western imagination, biblical shepherding occurs in an environment of scarcity where survival depends entirely on the shepherd's knowledge and voice. This imagery becomes a powerful metaphor for spiritual formation - God takes His people into "desert" experiences not to harm them, but to teach them dependence, trust, and how to recognize His voice above all others. The episode challenges us to examine whether we respond to God's guidance like sheep (obediently following the known voice) or like goats (thinking we know a better way). As Israel prepares to enter their 40-year wilderness journey in Numbers, understanding these desert dynamics becomes essential for grasping how God shapes His people through seasons of apparent scarcity and dependence.

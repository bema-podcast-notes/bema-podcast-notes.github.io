### BEMA Episode 4: His Bow in the Clouds - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 4: His Bow in the Clouds (E4v24)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon, Brent Billings, Elle Grover Fricks  
**Focus:** An examination of the Noah and flood narrative in Genesis 6-9, exploring how it contrasts with ancient Near Eastern flood stories and reveals God's unique character and covenant relationship with humanity.

#### Key Takeaways

- The biblical flood narrative intentionally contrasts with and reframes ancient Near Eastern flood stories like the Epic of Gilgamesh
- God's motivation for the flood differs dramatically from pagan gods - He acts against violence and evil, not because humans are merely annoying
- The story follows a chiastic structure centered on God "remembering" Noah (Genesis 8:1)
- The flood narrative parallels the creation account, presenting a "re-creation" story
- God's covenant with Noah represents a radical departure from typical ancient suzerain-vassal relationships
- The rainbow (Hebrew: keshet - meaning "bow") symbolizes God's weapon pointed away from earth toward heaven
- God promises to "Sabbath from destroying" even though human nature remains unchanged

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Comparative Ancient Literature
The flood narrative exists within a rich tapestry of ancient Near Eastern flood stories. The Epic of Gilgamesh provides crucial context:
- **Motivation difference:** In Gilgamesh, gods destroy humanity because people are noisy and disruptive to divine sleep
- **Divine character contrast:** Pagan gods flee in terror from their own destructive flood, cowering "like curs"
- **Control dynamics:** Biblical God remains sovereign throughout, while pagan gods lose control of their destruction

##### Chiastic Structure Analysis
The Noah narrative employs a sophisticated chiastic pattern:
- **Numerical framework:** 7-7-40-150-150-40-7-7 (days and time periods)
- **Center verse:** Genesis 8:1 - "But God remembered Noah..."
- **Bookends:** The phrase about human evil inclinations (Genesis 6:5 and 8:21)
- **Literary purpose:** Emphasizes God's remembrance and faithfulness

##### Re-Creation Theology
The flood story deliberately echoes Genesis 1 creation elements:
- **Ruach (Spirit/wind) over waters:** Parallels Genesis 1:2
- **Light through the ark window:** Echoes "Let there be light"
- **Separation of waters above and below:** Mirrors creation's cosmic ordering
- **Expected climax:** Should culminate in Sabbath, which it does - God's Sabbath from destroying

##### Covenant Innovation
The rainbow covenant subverts typical ancient covenant patterns:
- **Traditional suzerain-vassal structure:** Powerful ruler protects subjects in exchange for loyalty
- **God's radical departure:** Keeps the covenant sign (rainbow) for Himself rather than giving it to humans
- **Leverage abandonment:** God voluntarily gives up His power to threaten destruction
- **Unconditional commitment:** Promises faithfulness "even though" human nature remains corrupt

#### Examples & Applications

##### Historical Context - The Amarna Letters
The Amarna Letters provide real-world examples of suzerain-vassal relationships in the ancient Near East. City-states under Egyptian rule would write: "I have paid my tribute and taxes faithfully, yet bandits attack me. Remember our covenant and come rescue me." This demonstrates the conditional nature of typical ancient covenants - protection depended on faithful tribute payment.

##### Theological Application - Divine Character
Unlike ancient gods who acted capriciously or for selfish reasons, the biblical God:
- Acts against genuine moral evil (violence, corruption)
- Maintains sovereign control throughout judgment
- Immediately begins planning redemption even while executing judgment
- Commits to ongoing relationship despite human failure

##### Literary Technique - Reframing Familiar Stories
The biblical authors took well-known cultural narratives and retold them to reveal different truths about God's character. This technique appears throughout Scripture, showing how God's people learned to understand their God as fundamentally different from surrounding religious concepts.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Comparative mythology:** Study other ancient flood narratives (Sumerian, Akkadian, Egyptian) to understand the broader cultural conversation
- **Covenant theology:** Examine how the Noahic covenant relates to later biblical covenants (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New)
- **Hebrew language study:** Investigate the theological significance of key Hebrew terms like ruach, berit, keshet, and zakhar (remember)
- **Chiastic analysis:** Practice identifying chiastic structures in other biblical narratives
- **Ancient Near Eastern context:** Research the social and political structures that shaped biblical covenant language
- **Ecological theology:** Consider environmental implications of God's covenant with "all living creatures"

#### Comprehension Questions

1. How does the biblical account of God's motivation for the flood differ from the motivation attributed to gods in the Epic of Gilgamesh, and what does this reveal about the biblical understanding of God's character?

2. Explain the chiastic structure of the Noah narrative and discuss why Genesis 8:1 ("But God remembered Noah") serves as the pivotal center of the story.

3. What are the parallels between the flood narrative and the Genesis 1 creation account, and how do these parallels support the interpretation of the flood as a "re-creation" story?

4. Analyze the significance of God keeping the rainbow covenant sign for Himself rather than giving it to humanity. How does this differ from typical ancient covenant practices?

5. What does it mean that God promises to "Sabbath from destroying" even though "every inclination of the human heart" remains evil, and how does this demonstrate God's commitment to redemption over judgment?

#### Brief Personalized Summary

The Noah narrative emerges not as a simple children's story about animals and a boat, but as a sophisticated theological statement about God's character and His relationship with creation. By contrasting with familiar ancient flood stories, the biblical account reveals a God who acts against genuine evil rather than petty annoyance, maintains sovereign control throughout judgment, and most remarkably, commits Himself unconditionally to creation's redemption. The chiastic structure emphasizing God's "remembering" and the revolutionary covenant arrangement where God keeps His own sign point to a divine character utterly unlike the capricious gods of surrounding cultures. This story teaches us that even in judgment, God's heart remains oriented toward restoration, and His commitment to partnership with humanity transcends our failures and limitations.

### BEMA Episode 10 Study Notes: Walking the Blood Path

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 10: Walking the Blood Path (2016)  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 15-17  
**Main Topic:** Examining Avraham's evolving partnership with God through covenant-making, focusing on the blood path covenant ritual and the progression of God's expectations as His people mature in faith.

#### Key Takeaways

- God sometimes remains silent to protect us from making decisions that would derail our story
- Demanding answers from God can lead to partial information that we misinterpret and act upon incorrectly
- The blood path covenant demonstrates God's willingness to pay the price for our failures
- God meets us where we are but always calls us forward to take the next step
- As we mature in our relationship with God, His expectations increase accordingly
- Consequences from past mistakes (like Avraham's trip to Egypt) can influence future generations
- Trust requires walking forward without having all the answers

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### **The Blood Path Covenant (Genesis 15)**

The blood path covenant was an ancient Middle Eastern betrothal ritual where:
- Five animals (heifer, goat, ram, dove, pigeon) were arranged with the larger animals cut in half
- Blood drained into the center, forming a "blood path"
- The lesser party walked through first, pledging their life if they broke the covenant
- The greater party followed, making the same commitment

In Avraham's case, God walked through for both parties, symbolizing that He would pay the price for both His own faithfulness and Avraham's inevitable failures.

##### **Hebrew Narrative Technique: Repeated Dialogue Markers**

When the text repeats "and [person] said" without response, it indicates:
- Separate conversations with time gaps between them
- The first statement received no divine response
- Growing frustration or persistence in the second attempt

This appears in Avraham's demand for answers about his descendants and later in Hagar's interaction with the angel.

##### **Chiastic Structure in Genesis 17**

The circumcision covenant is arranged as a chiasm with circumcision at the center, emphasizing:
- The permanent, unforgettable nature of this covenant sign
- The evolution from God keeping the covenant sign (rainbow with Noah) to giving it to His people
- Increased responsibility and expectations as the partnership matures

##### **Progressive Revelation and Responsibility**

God's relationship with humanity shows increasing expectations:
- **Noah:** God keeps all covenant responsibilities
- **Avraham:** Shared responsibility with permanent covenant sign
- **Modern believers:** Even greater expectations given 4,000 years of additional revelation plus Christ and the Holy Spirit

#### Examples & Applications

##### **Avraham's Egypt Experience and Its Consequences**

Avraham's decision to trust Egypt during famine had lasting consequences:
- He brought Egyptian wealth and slaves back with him
- Hagar, an Egyptian slave, became part of the Ishmael storyline
- This illustrates how "it's easy for God to get us out of Egypt, but harder to get Egypt out of us"
- Our past compromises can affect future generations

##### **God's Strategic Silence**

Sometimes God withholds information because:
- We would make poor decisions with partial knowledge
- The journey of faith requires trust without complete understanding
- Character development happens through uncertainty and dependence

##### **Modern Application of Covenant Progression**

Just as God increased expectations for Avraham, modern believers should consider:
- How much more revelation we have through Scripture, Christ, and the Holy Spirit
- Whether we're growing in spiritual maturity or remaining static
- What "next steps" God might be calling us to take in faith

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- **Comparative Religious Studies:** Research other ancient covenant-making rituals and their similarities to biblical practices
- **Theological Development:** Trace how the Abrahamic covenant develops through Isaac, Jacob, and into the New Testament
- **Cultural Anthropology:** Study modern Bedouin cultures that still practice blood path-type covenants
- **Literary Analysis:** Examine other chiastic structures in Genesis and their theological significance
- **Historical Context:** Investigate the relationship between ancient Sumerian culture and Hebrew covenant practices

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Why did God remain silent after Avraham's first complaint about having no children, and what does this teach us about divine timing in our own lives?**

2. **Explain the significance of God walking through the blood path for both parties in the covenant. How does this foreshadow later biblical themes?**

3. **How do Avraham's consequences from trusting Egypt demonstrate the principle that "it's easy for God to get us out of Egypt, but harder to get Egypt out of us"?**

4. **What is the significance of circumcision being at the center of the chiasm in Genesis 17, and how does it represent an evolution from the Noah covenant?**

5. **Given that God's expectations increase as His people mature in faith, what implications does this have for modern believers who have access to the full biblical revelation and the Holy Spirit?**

#### Brief Summary

This episode explores three critical chapters in Avraham's journey, focusing on how God responds to human demands for certainty and security. The blood path covenant in Genesis 15 reveals a God willing to bear the consequences of human failure, while the circumcision covenant in Genesis 17 shows the progression toward shared responsibility as faith matures.

The key lesson is that God meets us where we are but never leaves us there - He always calls us forward to the next step of faith. Sometimes this means walking without all the answers, trusting that God's strategic silence protects us from making decisions that would derail our story. As we grow in our relationship with God, His expectations increase, challenging us to live up to the greater revelation and empowerment we've received through Christ and the Holy Spirit.

The episode demonstrates that faith is not about perfection but about persistent forward movement in partnership with God, learning from our mistakes while trusting in His ultimate faithfulness to fulfill His promises.

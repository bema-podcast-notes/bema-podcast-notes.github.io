### BEMA Episode 20: With All Your Heart - Study Notes

#### Title & Source Summary

**Episode:** BEMA 20: With All Your Heart (2025)  
**Hosts:** Marty Solomon, Brent Billings, with guest Reed Dent  
**Topic:** The story of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea and their first test on the journey to Mount Sinai, focusing on God's testing of their hearts through the bitter waters at Marah and the provision of manna.

#### Key Takeaways

- God's tests are not pass/fail assessments but opportunities for mutual experience - for us to show God what's in our hearts and to learn and grow in relationship with Him
- The Hebrew word for "know" (yada) implies intimate, experiential knowing rather than mere cerebral knowledge
- The Kingdom of God comes through three components: God's finger moving, people calling Him Lord, and people responding in obedience
- Testing in the Hebrew mindset involves both giving (showing God our hearts) and getting (learning from God)
- The heart (lev) in Hebrew thought represents the seat of will and choice, not just emotions
- Community care, particularly for the marginalized and weak, is central to God's expectations for His people
- The manna provision demonstrates God's desire for daily dependence rather than anxious accumulation

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Nature of Divine Testing
Testing (Hebrew: nasah) is fundamentally different from Western academic testing. God doesn't test to see if we pass or fail, but rather to experience our spiritual journey with us. The testing is like testing strips in a hot tub - measuring where we are to determine what we need next, not to grade us.

##### The Threefold Coming of the Kingdom
Jewish teaching identifies three necessary components for experiencing God's Kingdom on earth:
1. **The finger of God moves** - God acts and intervenes
2. **People call Him Lord** - Recognition and worship of God's authority  
3. **People respond in obedience** - Active submission to God's will

All three elements must be present for the full experience of God's Kingdom.

##### Biblical Knowing (Yada)
The Hebrew word yada represents intimate, experiential knowledge rather than intellectual data. When God wants to "know" what's in our hearts, He desires to experience our growth journey with us, not merely collect information about us.

##### The Heart as Seat of Will
In Hebrew thought, the heart (lev) is the center of volition and choice, not primarily emotions. The test of the heart examines what we will choose when faced with God's instructions.

##### Creation Language in Deliverance
The Red Sea crossing mirrors creation imagery - waters being separated, dry ground appearing, God's breath (wind) moving over the waters. This suggests that God's deliverance creates new realities using the same power that formed the original creation.

#### Examples & Applications

##### The Red Sea Crossing
- **Geographic Context:** The Israelites headed south toward a dead end rather than taking the logical northern coastal route, demonstrating God's unconventional methods
- **Dual Accounts:** Exodus 14 provides more historiographic language (east wind, Moses' staff) while Exodus 15 uses poetic language (God's nostrils, right hand), showing different registers for communicating the same divine reality

##### The Bitter Waters at Marah
- **Wordplay:** Marah means both "bitter" and "rebellious," highlighting the people's spiritual state
- **The Test:** According to Midrash, the statute given was that the weak and marginalized should drink first from the one well
- **God's Provision:** Just around the corner were 12 springs and 70 palm trees - abundance following the test of scarcity

##### The Manna Provision
- **Daily Dependence:** Gathering only what was needed each day taught trust rather than anxiety-driven accumulation
- **Sabbath Preparation:** Double gathering on the sixth day introduced Sabbath observance
- **Community Care:** Rabbinical interpretation suggests those who could gather more shared with those who couldn't, ensuring everyone had exactly what they needed

##### Desert Experience Perspective
Modern visitors to the Sinai wilderness gain appreciation for the Israelites' complaints - the heat radiating off canyon walls can feel like "baking in an oven," making survival concerns very real rather than faithless whining.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- The connection between manna sharing and Paul's teaching in 2 Corinthians 8 about Christian generosity
- The relationship between Moses and God as sometimes distinct, sometimes seemingly unified agents
- The role of Midrash in understanding biblical narratives and filling textual gaps
- Martin Buber's concept of "imaginative remembering" in biblical historiography
- The parallel between creation and redemption throughout Hebrew scripture
- Walter Brueggemann's work on biblical narrative and theological interpretation
- The concept of right-handed vs. left-handed power in understanding God's kingdom versus earthly empires
- Jewish numerology and symbolism in biblical narratives (12 wells, 70 palm trees)
- The significance of the pillar of cloud moving from front to back during the Red Sea crossing

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Explain the difference between biblical "testing" (nasah) and modern academic testing. How does understanding this difference change your perspective on trials in your own life?**

2. **What are the three components necessary for the Kingdom of God to come according to Jewish teaching, and how do you see these playing out (or not) in contemporary Christian communities?**

3. **How does the Hebrew concept of yada (knowing) help us understand what God desires in His relationship with us, and what does this suggest about the purpose of spiritual challenges?**

4. **According to the Midrashic interpretation of the Marah incident, what was the statute God gave the Israelites, and how does this connect to broader biblical themes about community care?**

5. **How do the dual accounts of the Red Sea crossing in Exodus 14 and 15 demonstrate different ways of communicating truth about God's intervention in history?**

#### Personal Summary

This episode reveals God's heart as a patient teacher who uses tests not to grade us but to journey with us toward spiritual maturity. The Israelites' complaints in the wilderness become more understandable when we consider the harsh realities of desert survival, reminding us to approach biblical characters with humility rather than condescension. 

The central lesson emerges through the testing of their hearts: God desires a people who will choose daily dependence on His word, care for the vulnerable in their community, and trust His provision even when it seems impossible. The manna's daily provision and the requirement to let the marginalized drink first at Marah both point toward a Kingdom economy based on trust and generosity rather than anxiety and accumulation.

Most significantly, God's desire to "know" (yada) what's in our hearts reveals His longing for intimate, experiential relationship rather than distant observation. He doesn't test us to discover information He lacks, but to experience our growth journey with us, celebrating our steps forward and patiently working with us through our failures. This transforms our understanding of both divine testing and spiritual formation - from performance-based religion to participatory relationship with a God who genuinely desires to walk through life with us.

# BEMA Episode 153: Romans â€” The Potter

## Title & Source Summary

This episode explores Romans 8:28-11:36, focusing on Paul's discussion of predestination, election, and God's relationship with both Jewish and Gentile believers. Marty Solomon and Brent Billings examine these concepts through the lens of first-century understanding, particularly the oracle system, to clarify misconceptions about predestination and demonstrate Paul's argument for the inclusion of Gentiles in God's covenant family.

## Key Takeaways

- Predestination in the first century was understood through the oracle system: "If you offer X sacrifice, and if you do Y, then it is predestined that Z will happen"
- Paul's argument focuses on God's acceptance and mercy, not rejection or exclusion
- The potter metaphor illustrates God's sovereignty in showing mercy to vessels "prepared for destruction"
- Romans 9-11 is primarily about defending the inclusion of Gentiles in God's covenant family
- God's gifts and calling to Israel are irrevocable - replacement theology is incorrect
- The olive tree metaphor shows Gentiles being grafted into Israel's story, not replacing it
- God uses even disobedience and stumbling to accomplish His redemptive purposes

## Main Concepts & Theories

### Ancient Oracle System and Predestination

The first-century understanding of predestination was rooted in the Greco-Roman oracle system. People would travel to oracles (like those at Delphi or Didyma) to receive messages from the gods. The formula was conditional: predestination was contingent upon obedience. This context reveals that Paul's discussion of predestination assumes the believer's choice to follow God's plan.

### The Potter and Clay Metaphor (Romans 9:19-24)

Paul uses the potter imagery to address Jewish concerns about God's sovereignty in accepting Gentiles. The metaphor doesn't focus on God's rejection but on His prerogative to show mercy. "Vessels prepared for destruction" refers to pagan Gentiles whom God bore "with great patience" rather than destroying, ultimately showing them mercy to demonstrate His glory.

### The Cultivated Olive Tree (Romans 11:17-24)

This agricultural metaphor illustrates the relationship between Jewish believers (cultivated olive tree) and Gentile believers (wild olive branches). The grafting process goes against nature - wild branches would typically harm a cultivated tree's productivity. This represents the scandalous nature of God's grace in including Gentiles while maintaining the Jewish foundation of faith.

### Replacement Theology vs. Grafting Theology

Paul explicitly argues against replacement theology - the idea that the church replaced Israel. Instead, he presents grafting theology: Gentiles are grafted into the existing covenant community of Israel. The translation "in this way all Israel will be saved" (not "and so") is crucial for understanding Paul's argument correctly.

## Examples & Applications

### Modern Parallels to First-Century Tensions

Just as first-century Jewish believers struggled to accept Gentile inclusion, established Christian communities today may struggle with accepting new believers or different expressions of faith. The episode encourages examining our own religious arrogance and exclusivity.

### The Remnant Principle

Paul references Elijah's discovery that God had preserved 7,000 who hadn't bowed to Baal, illustrating that God always maintains a faithful remnant. This principle applies to every generation - God is always working through people willing to partner with His redemptive purposes.

### Bread and Circus vs. Jesus as Lord

Paul appropriated the Roman imperial slogan "If you proclaim with your mouth that Caesar is Lord, you will be saved" and transformed it to "If you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord... you will be saved." This shows how the gospel directly challenges political and cultural power structures.

## Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- Study the specific Old Testament passages Paul quotes (Hosea, Isaiah, Deuteronomy, Psalms) in their original contexts
- Explore the concept of *gezerah shavah* (linking passages by common words/themes) in Jewish interpretation
- Investigate the historical context of oracles at Delphi and Didyma
- Examine the agricultural realities of olive tree cultivation and grafting in the ancient Mediterranean
- Research the development and problems of replacement theology throughout church history
- Study the concept of *bechor* (firstborn) and its role in Jewish family structure and theology

## Comprehension Questions

1. How does understanding the ancient oracle system change your interpretation of Paul's discussion on predestination in Romans 8:28-30?

2. What is the main point Paul is making with the potter and clay metaphor, and how does it relate to God's treatment of both Jews and Gentiles?

3. Explain the difference between replacement theology and grafting theology using Paul's olive tree metaphor. Why is this distinction important?

4. How does Paul use Old Testament quotations to support his argument about Gentile inclusion, and what does this reveal about his intended audience?

5. What does Paul mean when he says God's "gifts and call are irrevocable," and how does this relate to his overall argument in Romans 9-11?

## Brief Personalized Summary

This episode provides crucial context for understanding some of the most contested passages in Romans. By examining Paul's arguments through first-century eyes rather than through later theological debates, we discover that his primary concern is not resolving questions about divine sovereignty and human free will, but rather defending the scandalous inclusion of Gentiles in God's covenant family.

The episode challenges both Jewish exclusivity and Gentile arrogance, showing how God's mercy extends to all people while maintaining the foundational role of Israel in His redemptive plan. Paul's sophisticated use of Old Testament texts and contemporary metaphors (oracles, pottery, olive cultivation) reveals a brilliant theological mind addressing practical community tensions.

Most significantly, this study reveals God as the divine Potter who specializes in showing mercy to vessels others might consider worthless, and as the Master Gardener who creates beauty through the seemingly impossible grafting of wild branches into His cultivated tree. The message remains relevant today: God's grace is scandalous, His mercy is comprehensive, and His people are called to be ambassadors of this radical inclusion rather than gatekeepers of exclusive privilege.

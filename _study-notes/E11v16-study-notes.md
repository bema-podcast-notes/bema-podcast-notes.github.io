### BEMA Episode 11 Study Notes: Here I Am

#### Title & Source Summary
**Episode:** BEMA 11: Here I Am (2016)  
**Scripture Focus:** Genesis 18-22  
**Main Topic:** Exploring Abraham's character through his radical hospitality and unwavering commitment to being present with others, even in the most difficult circumstances. The episode examines how Abraham models what it means to be a faithful partner with God through self-sacrifice and trust.

#### Key Takeaways
- Abraham's defining characteristic is radical hospitality that goes far beyond cultural norms
- True faith involves being present with others ("Here I am" - *hineni*) rather than abandoning them in times of crisis
- Abraham consistently chooses self-sacrifice over self-preservation, making him God's chosen partner
- The stories of Hagar/Ishmael and Isaac are deliberately placed together to contrast abandonment with faithfulness
- God uses Eastern teaching methods (experiential learning) rather than Western approaches (informational transfer)
- Abraham's mistakes don't define him - he learns from them and continues moving forward
- The binding of Isaac (*Akedah*) reveals God's character as one who provides rather than demands sacrifice

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### The Premium on Hospitality
Middle Eastern culture places extraordinary value on hospitality, tracing this tradition back to Abraham. The hosts describe experiencing this firsthand in a Bedouin village where 54 unexpected guests were welcomed with complete generosity. Abraham's hospitality in Genesis 18 exemplifies this radical welcome:
- He hurries to serve three strangers despite recovering from circumcision
- He prepares 60 pounds of flour (enough for 80 loaves of bread) for three guests
- He personally serves rather than delegating to his 318 household members

##### The *Hineni* Principle
The Hebrew word *hineni* ("here I am") appears at crucial moments in the chiastic structure of Genesis 22. This represents:
- **Presence over abandonment**: Being fully present with others in their need
- **Commitment over convenience**: Staying through difficulty rather than fleeing
- **God's character revealed**: God's name "I AM" connects to this concept of eternal presence

##### The Contrast Between Hagar and Abraham
Two parallel stories in Genesis 21-22 reveal different responses to crisis:

**Hagar's Response (Genesis 21):**
- Abandons Ishmael under a bush when water runs out
- Distances herself "about a bowshot away"
- Cannot bear to watch her child die

**Abraham's Response (Genesis 22):**
- Commits to staying with Isaac throughout the ordeal
- When Isaac asks about the sacrifice, Abraham responds with *hineni*
- Demonstrates radical presence even when commanded to sacrifice his son

##### Eastern vs. Western Teaching Methods
God doesn't simply tell Abraham that child sacrifice is wrong (Western approach). Instead, He creates an unforgettable experiential lesson (Eastern approach) where Abraham discovers God's true character through action rather than information.

##### The Three Character Types in Genesis
Midrash identifies three approaches to engaging the world:
- **Noah the Insulator**: "The man in the fur coat" who only cares for his own family
- **Lot the Assimilator**: Rises to prominence in Sodom but loses his ability to impact culture
- **Abraham the Engager**: Remains distinct while actively engaging and impacting his culture

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Hospitality Challenges
The hosts challenge listeners to consider their own response to unexpected guests, particularly those from different cultures or backgrounds. They note how fear and security concerns often prevent the radical hospitality that Abraham modeled.

##### Learning from Mistakes
Abraham repeats his mistake with Abimelech (claiming Sarah is his sister), showing that even faithful people struggle with the same issues repeatedly. The key is not letting these failures define us but continuing to move forward in faith.

##### Presence in Crisis
Abraham's commitment to stay with Isaac during their darkest moment provides a model for how we can support others through difficulty - not by having all the answers, but by simply being present and saying "here I am."

##### Cultural Context of Sacrifice
Understanding that child sacrifice was normal in Abraham's cultural context helps explain why God's command wasn't shocking to Abraham, but also illuminates God's revolutionary message that He provides the sacrifice rather than demanding it.

#### Potential Areas for Further Exploration

- The concept of *tsa'aqah* (the cry of the oppressed) and how God responds to injustice
- The theological implications of God's testing and how it differs from temptation
- The role of circumcision as a covenant sign and what it means for partnership with God
- The connection between Abraham's story and the Exodus narrative (God's name revealed to Moses)
- Chiastic structure analysis in Hebrew narrative and its theological significance
- The development of hospitality laws in Torah and their connection to Abraham's example
- Comparative analysis of sacrifice systems in ancient Near Eastern religions

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analysis**: How do the parallel structures between Genesis 21 (Hagar and Ishmael) and Genesis 22 (Abraham and Isaac) reveal different approaches to crisis, and what does this teach us about faithfulness?

2. **Application**: The hosts describe experiencing radical Middle Eastern hospitality that challenged their cultural assumptions. How might practicing Abraham-like hospitality in our context require us to move beyond fear-based living?

3. **Interpretation**: Explain the significance of the Hebrew word *hineni* ("here I am") in the chiastic structure of Genesis 22. How does this concept connect to God's revelation of His name to Moses and to Jesus's responses in the New Testament?

4. **Synthesis**: How does understanding the cultural normalcy of child sacrifice in Abraham's time change our interpretation of the binding of Isaac story? What does this reveal about God's teaching methods?

5. **Evaluation**: Abraham makes significant mistakes (lying about Sarah, the Hagar situation) yet remains God's chosen partner. What principles can we draw from Abraham's pattern of failure, learning, and forward movement rather than settling in his mistakes?

#### Brief Summary

This episode reveals Abraham as a man defined by radical hospitality and unwavering presence with others. Through the parallel stories of Hagar/Ishmael and the binding of Isaac, we see the contrast between abandonment and faithfulness. Abraham's response of *hineni* ("here I am") becomes a defining characteristic - he commits to staying present even in the most difficult circumstances. The binding of Isaac serves not as a test of Abraham's willingness to kill his son, but as God's revolutionary teaching moment revealing that He provides the sacrifice rather than demanding it. Abraham's pattern of self-sacrifice, learning from mistakes without being defined by them, and radical hospitality makes him the partner God chooses to bless all nations. The episode challenges us to move beyond fear-based living toward the kind of generous, present, and hospitable life that can partner with God in restoring the world.

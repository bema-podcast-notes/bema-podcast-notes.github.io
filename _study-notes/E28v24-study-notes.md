### BEMA Episode 28: Images of the Desert — Ar'ar and Tamarisk

#### Title & Source Summary
This episode explores two significant desert plants - the Ar'ar bush and the Tamarisk tree - as biblical imagery for understanding spiritual truths about trust, faithfulness, and generational impact. The discussion builds on previous episodes about the Tabernacle, priesthood, and the Israelites' wilderness experience as a "honeymoon in the desert" following their covenant relationship with God at Mount Sinai.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Priests as Opulent Delegates**: Hebrew "kohen" means one who undertakes another's cause and represents divine abundance
- **Ar'ar Bush Paradox**: Beautiful exterior concealing toxic, empty interior - represents trusting in human flesh/abilities
- **Acacia Tree Wisdom**: Appears dead externally but contains life-giving resources - represents trusting in God's provision
- **Tamarisk Tree Legacy**: Takes 80 years to mature, planted for future generations - symbolizes long-term kingdom investment
- **Jeremiah 17 Connection**: Contrasts cursed reliance on human strength with blessed trust in God through desert plant imagery
- **Generational Thinking**: The question "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" challenges us to invest in future generations

#### Main Concepts & Theories

##### Priestly Identity and Role
The Hebrew word "kohen" (priest) carries two essential meanings from cognate languages:
- **Deputy/Delegate**: One who undertakes another's cause, standing in the gap between God and people
- **Opulence/Abundance**: Representatives displaying the richness of God's realm through their appearance and actions

This dual role involves both pleading the people's cause to God and presenting God's cause to the people, making priests bidirectional mediators dressed to reflect heavenly abundance.

##### Desert Plant Symbolism Framework
The episode establishes a comprehensive symbolic system using desert vegetation:

**Ar'ar Bush (ערער)**:
- Linguistically connected to "arur" (curse) - strongest Hebrew word for binding someone to destruction
- Visually stunning with bright green foliage and yellow branches
- Internally toxic and empty - fruit appears promising but contains only cobwebs and poisonous milky substance
- Represents those who trust in human abilities and appear successful externally but lack substance

**Acacia Tree (Rotem)**:
- Can appear completely dead for extended periods
- Called "gift of the desert" by Bedouins for its life-sustaining properties
- Primary wood used in Tabernacle construction (Ark of Covenant, altars, poles)
- When overlaid with gold, creates "opulent delegate" imagery - beautiful exterior with strong, durable interior
- Represents faithful trust in God that may appear unremarkable but provides lasting value

**Tamarisk Tree**:
- Requires cultivation and 80 years to reach maturity
- Creates shade 15% cooler than standard shade through moisture redistribution
- Considered a luxury tree in ancient culture (referenced in Akkadian poetry alongside date palms)
- Symbolizes generational investment and long-term kingdom thinking

##### Jeremiah 17 Theological Framework
The passage creates a deliberate contrast using wordplay:
- "Arur" (cursed) connects to "ar'ar" (bush) in "arava" (desert wasteland)
- Cursed person trusting in flesh becomes like the toxic ar'ar bush
- Blessed person trusting in God becomes like the life-giving tree by water (acacia)
- This establishes external appearance versus internal reality as a key biblical theme

##### Abraham's Covenant Symbolism
Abraham's planting of a tamarisk tree at Beersheba after making a treaty represents:
- Faith in God's long-term promises extending beyond his lifetime
- Calling on "Adonai Olam" (Eternal God) - connecting tree's longevity to God's eternal nature
- Physical witness to covenant faithfulness for future generations
- Statement of belief in God's continued work in that place

#### Examples & Applications

##### Modern Priesthood Applications
- **Corporate Leadership**: Representing company values while advocating for employee needs
- **Parenting**: Modeling godly abundance while interceding for children's spiritual development  
- **Ministry**: Displaying God's richness through lifestyle while addressing community needs
- **Teaching**: Presenting eternal truths with excellence while understanding student struggles

##### Ar'ar vs. Acacia in Contemporary Context
- **Social Media Presence**: Curated perfection (ar'ar) versus authentic struggle and growth (acacia)
- **Career Success**: Impressive credentials hiding moral emptiness versus quiet integrity producing lasting impact
- **Church Culture**: Flashy programs lacking spiritual depth versus humble faithfulness bearing genuine fruit
- **Personal Relationships**: Surface-level charm masking selfishness versus unassuming loyalty providing security

##### Tamarisk Tree Investment Strategies
- **Mentoring**: Investing in younger believers who will impact generations beyond our reach
- **Educational Giving**: Supporting institutions that will train future leaders
- **Environmental Stewardship**: Making sustainable choices for future generations
- **Church Planting**: Establishing congregations that will multiply long after founders are gone
- **Writing/Teaching**: Creating resources that will benefit people we'll never meet

#### Comprehension Questions

1. **Analyze the priestly role**: How do the two aspects of priesthood - being a delegate/deputy and displaying opulence - work together in both ancient Israel and contemporary Christian life? Provide specific examples of how modern believers might fulfill both functions.

2. **Compare and contrast**: Create a detailed comparison between the ar'ar bush and acacia tree, explaining how their physical characteristics relate to spiritual principles about trust and faithfulness. How might these principles apply to evaluating modern churches or Christian leaders?

3. **Examine the linguistic connections**: Explain the Hebrew wordplay in Jeremiah 17 between "arur" (cursed), "ar'ar" (bush), and "arava" (wasteland). How does this linguistic artistry enhance the theological message, and what does this teach us about biblical interpretation methods?

4. **Evaluate generational investment**: Abraham's tamarisk tree planting represents long-term kingdom thinking. Identify three specific areas in your life where you could plant "tamarisk trees" - investments that primarily benefit future generations rather than yourself. Explain your reasoning for each choice.

5. **Apply the desert imagery framework**: Choose a current personal challenge or decision you're facing. Using the desert plant imagery from this episode (ar'ar, acacia, and tamarisk), analyze your situation and determine which approach would be most faithful to biblical wisdom. Justify your analysis with specific references to the plant characteristics discussed.

#### Personal Summary

This episode masterfully demonstrates how biblical imagery drawn from the natural world can illuminate profound spiritual truths about authenticity, faithfulness, and generational impact. The contrast between the deceptively beautiful but toxic ar'ar bush and the apparently lifeless but life-giving acacia tree challenges us to examine whether our spiritual lives prioritize external appearance or internal substance.

The priestly concept of being an "opulent delegate" offers a compelling framework for Christian living - representing God's abundance while advocating for others' needs. This dual role requires both displaying divine richness and undertaking others' causes, creating a balanced approach to spiritual influence.

Perhaps most powerfully, the tamarisk tree metaphor reframes how we measure success and impact. Abraham's 80-year investment in a tree he would never see fully grown challenges our immediate-gratification culture and calls us to plant seeds for spiritual grandchildren we may never meet. The rabbinic question "How many tamarisk trees did you plant today?" becomes a daily examination of conscience, pushing us beyond personal benefit toward kingdom legacy.

The episode's integration of Hebrew linguistics, botanical knowledge, and theological insight exemplifies how cultural context enriches biblical understanding. Rather than merely reading over seemingly insignificant details like Abraham planting a tree, we discover profound statements of faith and theological conviction embedded in everyday actions.

These desert images ultimately call us to authentic discipleship - avoiding the ar'ar's hollow attractiveness, embracing the acacia's patient faithfulness, and committing to the tamarisk's generational vision. In a world obsessed with immediate results and external validation, these ancient plants offer timeless wisdom about what truly matters in God's kingdom economy.
